1501,"A conversation we could both benefit from. I myself am not suicidal. But I have been before. 
I'm here to talk to whoever would love to talk to someone.  
I'm a 22 year old female who has been blessed with good opportunities in life. I had a terrible bout in high school where I felt I went insane. I felt I had no control over my emotions, thoughts, and at times my own actions. I was put on medication and was almost sure I self-diagnosed myself with BPD. Fast forward a few years and I quit the meds and am mentally stable, even truly happy. 

But the last month or two things have been dwindling it feels. I have always been a daily bud smoker, but my alcohol consumption upped and I'm feeling best when asleep. This morning I woke up feeling empty, nothing. I couldn't get myself out of bed and had to call into work. I spent all day sleeping because being asleep is almost like not being alive... a small coma. I wouldn't consider suicide these days, but also some days I really wouldn't mind not being alive. 

I'm a wonderful listener and a very open person. If you feel the need to speak with someone, I would love to give you company and support.

1503,"A rant about what a miserable little shit I am.Time drags on forever. I feel dead inside and nothing besides something visceral, like food and masturbation, brings true joy to me. My only parent doesn't understand me and believes I'm just spoiled and that's the internet's fault somehow (that's common for people raised in USSR — they treat everone younger and their problems as soft and spoiled). My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone. Entrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide make cold run down my limbs.

I dream of going somewhere like Iceland, a remote small country where everyone knows each other, but I can't make myself work for it. I have no power left to do anything meaningful, I abandoned my studies and barely go to classes. I would love to hear anything in response, but I know that won't change anything for me, I act like I have no future.",1,,rant miserable little shit anytime drags forever feel dead inside visceral like food masturbation brings true joy parent doesnt understand believes im spoiled thats internets fault thats common people raised ussr treat everone younger problems soft spoiled psychiatrist believes depression teenage fade havent friends 12 close friend ive parted truly intrusive thoughts selfharm suicide cold run limbs dream going like iceland remote small country knows cant work power left meaningful abandoned studies barely classes love hear response know wont change act like future

1510,"Im trying, but things keep getting worseI got into a Masters course last year and have done quite well so far, only to realize that my college's professors simply do not know enough about the subject and are continuously placing obstacles in our path. My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   
I don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   
Why should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago. This isn't a fantasy world where a person has unlimited resources and time. I have never come across a worse phrase than ""failures are the stepping stones of success"". Perhaps its applicable for people who don't have much to lose.   
But i am losing everything, and hopefully, i will soon lose my life as well.

I don't want to work just so I can survive to work yet another month. I will never sell my mind to someone or something I don't believe in. And this alone is enough to be an outcast, both socially and professionally. I find it weird how we prevent people from killing themselves yet all follow and support structures that beat them to it without even realising it. Not like I have an answer, the past, present and future key to our survival is a well functioning and productive society, not the well being of free radicals. But I have to add that depression isn't an illness, the norm is. Depressed people are more likely to realistically judge a situation.

I'll try once again, and maybe a few times after that. But after a fixed age, and without any solid improvement, I'm just going to call it quits.

She sauntered into the room, her enormous breasts swaying from side-to-side like a great grandfather clock, glistening enticingly, her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday evening.

The throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a high-pitched grown. A dog whistle of sorts. A siren call that made my 18-inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog house.

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain. 

""You like that bebe?"" I grumbled.

Her nipples gazed at me with lust and thirst.

1536,"I think I will do itNot right now. But soon. I've just had enough. 

I'm 27 year old female. My story is this:

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away). I went to hospital for a while and when I got back to home, I continued all my bad habits.

1552,"It's my 22nd birthday and that's 22 too much for me**+++ For the record, I'm not following any of the shit ideas my head has. At least don't intend to. +++**

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

I have chronic pain and it's awful. I just want to stop that. I want it to end. It hurts. My body as well as my mind. I can't handle it.",1,,birthday thats 22 me+++ record im following shit ideas head dont intend +++ life ive abandoned neglected traumatized got 50 traumatic family totally shitty friends abandoned im good annoying things midnight posting depressing meme reddit prepared hour whilst crying sitting room feel dead inside time like im eplode head constantly having thoughts like today overdosing painkillers subway thinking better thats annoying know best way wouldnt want involve thing thatd awful birthday feel like ask apology wasnt aborted resents end theres family hateful especially mother cut contact confirmed father likely glad committed suicide wanna vanish cant lost suicide feeling cant ones love feel like want cease eist hate dont know dont know writing dont actually intend month 2 years selfharmfree cut heavily doesnt cause emotions missing having way cope eating disorder flaring fake sense control maybe die loses suicide chance 15 maybe diseases gets chronic pain awful want stop want end hurts body mind cant handle

1595,"I don't even know why am I writing thisI feel so stuck, so bound in this situation.
In 3 hours I'm going at work again, where I'm going to suffer the same injustices everyone suffers everywhere at every job, and even worst, but really I can't take anymore those people being slower than me, and yet blaming me for things i shouldn't be blamed of. 
I had so many fights, but yet I can't revolt against them more than I already did cause I need this damn job.

So I'm super stressed at work but when I go back home there's my damn family situation, my mom says in 5 days the judge is coming to our home to see what can be taken away and sold so the state can get his tax money back, the ones my dad wasn't able to pay. ""Fortunately"" (I don't really care) they said if we give them 4000 euro right now they'll make us a payment plan for the restant 40000 euros... So I'll have to ""lend"" my money to my dad again (I know I'll never see them back) this month and the same story comes along every damn month.
My dad has debts everywhere, I don't even know how much, and my mom says I'll have to hold on for other like 3-4 years in this cursed situation. 
But this is just an random estimate. I'm forced in this situation, I'm 23 years old and don't know when I'll be free, maybe when I'll be 30?
Our home is under risk every month.

Then, even worst, my mom is sick, she can't work, my dad left and betrayed her, I DON'T love her but I feel forced to take care of here until she dies or takes away her own life.
I don't have any mental illness, I'd like to become a music producer, to make money, I think love is so stupid and I don't care for anyone other than my self, and I believe everyone is egoistic too in the deep inside, but yet I'm scared of death, feel so coward. Hanging hurts, ""mortal"" electrical towers are not mortal at all, the only thing I could do right now would be to take the knife I usually take to my job, which has a new sharp blade and cut my throat but I'm so scared of how it would hurt, and I'm so stupidly worried about the shock I'll cause to my mom...

I can be better. Yet at the same time, I can't and never will be. My brain is completely fried, endlessly blank, or continuously searching.

When my mind is underwhelmed by its own-self it desires something to feed it, knowledge, art, music. Just something. When you throw it for a loop, everything goes haywire. I collapse. I cry. Every emotion grounding me to my own character no longer holds up. Nothing feels real

But maybe its just experience. Maybe that's all it wanted. The human experience. To live-life. To stop floating. I don't want to argue with you. I don't want to upset you. I don't want you to hate me. So I'll give up my fight, compress my stupid fkin emotions. I'll stop being around you, you probably just pity me. ugly me, stupid me. Annoying weirdo. look at her- she must hate everyone- that's why she doesn't talk to anyone- its cause shes antisocial and ill. So full of herself. She must be.{ while the thought of someone I know maybe committing suicide (because of certain signs) throws me into panic}

I don't care anymore. there's only a small ass fraction of me that dose. and i've drowned it. I swear I did

But I'm just an asshole to my parents. who are assholes to me. Just what I deserved. A miserable life without anyone. Its what I get. I deserve the worst. SO many people have been through worse than me. My life isn't that bad you stupid fuck. stop complaining. STOP STOP STOP. make it stop

It's really silly, isn't it?

How a simple hobby was the last thing keeping you grounded and sane.

Now its gone cause I'm a lazy piece of ADHD shit

Maybe I can starve myself again. 

I need to cope somehow. crying to your parents (as they dismiss it as me having a teenager tantrum) while subconsciously thrashing your head into the wall in frustration is just gonna make your dad slap you

Your mom wants you to starve, she keeps not so subtly pointing out things that very obviously correlate to my weight gain. She refers to the time that she very well knows I was starving myself (She said that I was, and mentioned the fact I was after the fact) as me being healthy. Even if I pointed it out she would deny and twist it. Cause she's a fucking liar. (she always does that when I point out whatever she is doing) then bring on any other subject about me doing things badly and wrong to my face and continue on.

 I don't know who I am. Neither do you. Nor will anything.

1632,"Almost drove myself to death todaySo I often have those suicidal thoughts coming from out of nowhere but I never got close to actually translate them into action because I know what it's like if someone you know or even love takes his own life. 

However, today my group got a pretty bad feedback for our presentation and overall work although I've worked very hard for it. I'm in university and work 20 hours a week to be able to actually live and not have to be too careful with money. 

The feedback and overall stress somehow triggered me. Why am I even doing this? I have a job that earns me a lot of money, I study mechanical engineering and I'm living together with a very loving and caring girlfriend. It wasn't easy to achieve all of this but I thought if I force myself to put in some energy to make it better I'd actually feel better. But I don't.  I even feel worse.

I don't really have a history of being suicidal, always been too scared of death. At worst, I'd get ""bursts"" of feeling like ending it but it would usually happen once every few months and would never last long.

Now, however, I am getting increasingly concerned. Got the invasive thoughts and desperation, if you will, two or three days ago. Except, this time, they are not going away. Quite the opposite, even. To make matters worse, I was going to bring it up at my psych appointment this week but it got cancelled.

I can't say I will attempt anything at this current state but I doubt I can last long.

In the past few months, things have changed though. I haven't been happy, but I don't feel sad anymore. I don't know if this is what people mean when they say it gets better, but I guess it did get better.

1642,"I've day dreamed of killing myself since I was a child...No throwaway, nothing like that. I've tried describing this feeling to my parents, but even with history of trauma I grew up in not the best house hold. No father, mother working two jobs, brothers and sisters all much older. My oldest brother has almost a 20 year age difference on me.

Anyways, I don't know why. It's something I've tried to be vocal about but I find that in modern days those who ""want to help"" are far more fucking annoying than those who will just have a logical conversation with ideas, opinions, facts, thoughts to be shared. 

I'm not going to kill myself this second, nor do I plan on it. But I do often day dream of killing myself, how it'd affect others. And more recently, the past year or so after experimentation with pot, women, and living I really got a new perspective. I was no longer that basement dwelling kid who played video games all day, but instead I'd smoke, bang hot chicks, and have friends. 

Well that's how everyone wants me to live my life, but I don't, and I can't be happy doing what I used to do. I find that more often than not, as of recent, I've wanted to kill myself not for the harm and sadness it'd cause others, but more because I can no longer take others...

It's not easy communicating with people who don't understand, aren't too bright, or just generally don't even process your information even when they seem to be hearing the words you're saying. My family, it's not very easy... a lot of addicts, but not junkies... worse. Functioning, middle class, addicts. 

The happy glow on the outside quickly becomes the regular fighting, pill popping, and drinking. 

I'm at a point where there's nothing here left for me, I'm still youngish, 18. But I've lived a pretty eventful life, I've had a lot of amazing opportunities to work with people I looked at as celebrities (On YouTube) due to my work in Graphic Design, Animation, and entertainment. I've had thousands of hours of laughs and smiles, and perhaps just as many in the real world as I did the online world.

I don't suppose there's a point to any of this, but I feel like I wanted to just tell somebody. I have a female friend in another state, we've known each other for many years now and I don't know. I want to tell her I love her, but I don't. I don't love her, she likes me a lot, but to me she's the only person I have mentally/intellectually. I can't converse or discuss anything with anyone else seemingly, I had a bad break up like half a year back and I was happy before that? I think, and before the girl I broke up with. I don't know, my point is, I know I don't love the first girl, my friend so I instead went and hugged my mother and told her I loved her, and she gave me a groan and a pissy face unlike normal (normal meaning, the other ~4 times I've gone up to my mom in that manner, hugged her, and told her I loved her in the past year). I know its' just because of her current situation, having to go down to my sisters' house to wash clothes, and my brother getting on her nerves... ugh, I used to love the kid, seriously. But I can't stand the fucking sight of my own brother anymore. I think I'm gonna leave soon, not leave leave. But I need some space. 

I want to delete this, all of this, just as I have many posts similar in the past. But I'm just going to see what happens, and if anyone of you can help, can explain to me what's going on this fucking skull because it feels like a process is using all of my brains CPU and I'm fucking overworked and overloaded but I fucking do nothing all day besidAwzsedX ",1,,ive day dreamed killing childno throwaway like ive tried describing feeling parents history trauma grew best house hold father mother working jobs brothers sisters older oldest brother 20 year age difference anyways dont know ive tried vocal find modern days want help far fucking annoying logical conversation ideas opinions facts thoughts shared im going kill second plan day dream killing itd affect recently past year eperimentation pot women living got new perspective longer basement dwelling kid played video games day instead id smoke bang hot chicks friends thats wants live life dont cant happy find recent ive wanted kill harm sadness itd cause longer easy communicating people dont understand arent bright generally dont process information hearing words youre saying family easy lot addicts junkies worse functioning middle class addicts happy glow outside quickly regular fighting pill popping drinking im point theres left im youngish 18 ive lived pretty eventful life ive lot amazing opportunities work people looked celebrities youtube work graphic design animation entertainment ive thousands hours laughs smiles real world online world dont suppose theres point feel like wanted tell somebody female friend state weve known years dont know want tell love dont dont love likes lot shes person mentally intellectually cant converse discuss seemingly bad break like half year happy think girl broke dont know point know dont love girl friend instead went hugged mother told loved gave groan pissy face unlike normal normal meaning times ive gone mom manner hugged told loved past years know current situation having sisters house wash clothes brother getting nerves ugh love kids seriously cant stand fucking sight brother anymore think im gonna leave soon leave leave need space want delete posts similar past im going happens help eplain whats going fucking skull feels like process brains cpu im fucking overworked overloaded fucking day besidawzsed

My mother got rid of my cat when I was 15 as punishment. I've never been able to form any sort of real relationships, because I kept lying about myself and pushing people away out of shame of how bad my life really is. I don't have things I enjoy either anymore, but just things that help me escape reality for a short time.

I can't afford the MRI I need to be able to get a Cortizone steroid shot in the disc area of my back. I can't afford any more chiropractic nor physical therapy. I can't afford to see my therapist anymore.

1649,"I don't know why I'm here.Every part of my family is dying off one by one. I spend my days going through the motions but my mind isn't in it anymore. I hardly remember what I do on a daily basis. I'm continually slipping further away.

Since my mom died, I've been ready to follow her into the grave. But one morning I realized that my death would leave my sister in a worse position. I've spent months feeling like I'm having a heart attack, blood clot, or any number of deadly conditions. 

None of this matters. Everyone is going to leave. Family is supposed to be there for you forever but they won't be. They'll move on be it through death or any number of instances.

I wish I were never born. I wish I could have chosen if I wanted to exist. It seems pretty fucked up that we don't get a choice. It's a pretty big decision. I wish I had died as a child. I wish I had never seen the things I have.

Everything is boring or stupid. I can't fucking stand people anymore. Their little stupid quips here and there. They all think they're fucking special but they're not. No one is. This planet would be better off is half of us died anyway.

I can't get out of bed before noon, and I can't resist the urge to nap or else lay in bed staring at the walls for hours a day.

We all like to pretend that everything is a-okay. We like to think that ""we're strong as long as we're in this together"" or some bullshit. But you know what? Not a single one of us has some mystical power that makes things okay again. We're all fucking helpless.

I pushed it all down for years. I hid from the emotion and refused to acknowledge the issues. I was nicknamed ""Hitler"" in highschool because shit just rolled off my back. But everything has rolled into the station - full fucking steam ahead.

What am I supposed to do? Just be okay? Pretend that nothing happened? That shit doesn't just go away. There's no fucking magical potion that takes all the memories away - aside from bleach I guess - but memories make the person.

I heard some girls driving along in their fancy car with their family/friends. They had the windows down and were laughing loudly in traffic. I should be happy that someone else can find happiness, but I fucking hate them. I hate that little ignorant bitches can be happy like that. Their stupid high pitched squeals. They think they're so fucking special. But one day, three of the four people in that car will be dead, and one girl will remain. I wonder if things will be better for her. Who knows, they might be worse.

Why can't the planet just explode all at once?

I don't feel close to anyone the way I used to. I don't feel close to my boyfriend or my friend of 13+ years. Or my sister. Though I can identify with her a little more than anyone else. But people just annoy me. Lately, I can't stand people dropping by my house. I'm always happy for the first minute they show and up, and I'm happy for the first minute after they leave. But when they're around, I can't connect at all. I find myself staring at them, nodding but not really hearing whatever it is they're talking about. I just stare. Sometime I think about how they can be so fucking happy, and other times I just stare.

I find myself staring at people in public too, sometimes hating them and other times not thinking at all.

I feel like I'm eking a little closer to insanity with each passing second. Why do people even try? After everything, we're all going to die anyway. Why does it matter if someone died today or years from now? It's just speeding the inevitable. Life is agony. I live for the next moment I can finally fall asleep again.

I have never been tested for it because I really don’t want the fuss and besides the medication doesn’t work, my mum was on fluoxetine which is an anti depressant and on the 18 th of february she slit her wrists knowing I was in the house but I have wrote about that before and I do not think I removed it so feel free to read it. I moved from my old school in nottingham to fucking cumbria (and no I am not that prick who is running for the youth council he is just some other guy from nottingham). cumbria is a shithole county full of shitty people who lead shitty lives and have shitty kids to contribute shit all to the shitty society but to be honest I don’t care about that, I just miss having friends irl. I made friends with a really nice girl from florida and we talk almost every day but due to the fact that it’s like 5 hours behind when I want to talk she is usually asleep or at school. I had 4 really good friends on csgo and we often played all through the day and night when I lived in nottingham but now I can’t even talk to them cause I have shit internet which has a data limit cause bt are cunts and don’t have a 6 month contract which we could have taken up for this house (a rental cause our house isn’t even fucking done yet).

I went to my councillor at school once after what happened but that was bullshit and she didn’t help. I didn’t feel comfortable sharing information about what I felt in case I was seen as a risk to myself and got sent to a mad house. I don’t want to go to a mad house cause I am not mad, i fact I believe myself to be the sanest person I know most of the time.

over the past month it seems like my life has been flipped upside down which has made all the shit that wasn’t boxed away in some distant part of my head spill everywhere. This couldn’t have came at a worse time this academic year as I am taking my mock exams for next years GCSE’s and when I am sat in the silent room I can’t stop thinking about what happened, replaying it over and over in my head. I usually do well in exams getting 9’s in science, 8’s in maths and computer science and 7’s in the rest (apart from french because french is the root of pure evil) but in these exams I don’t think I did well. I revised really hard for my maths exam but I don’t think I did well, I am close to being moved down to second set and if I do then I will be average at everything. I am gifted with chemistry and physics, well I assume so due to me getting better then the old A*’s a year early, but I am in a shit set and no teacher will move me. I feel afraid that if I fail these exams I will end up doing something stupid, I was gunna OD on my mums pills but I found out that they don’t work very well so that’s out the window. I just don’t know what to do, I just want everything to be over, I am nice to people and mind my own business and don’t try to be funny and just try to seem like a nice enough person to be friends with but it seems like it doesn’t work but I don’t want to change because then I would become that which I hate, people who try to be funny and seem funny but end up acting like cunts.

1679,"What could I do?Hi, everyone, thanks for clicking on this link. I'm a nihilist as you may have seen on my name
I've thought about killing myself a lot of times lately, I know that life is pointless, every human being is just dictated by its conservation and survival instincts as well as their personal pleasure, I know that killing myself would be painless as I know some fast and good methods. I also don't care much about what impact it would have on my friends, family and society as I won't be there to regret anything (I don't believe in gods or afterworlds, to me these are just stuff that humans invented because they couldn't believe that we are pointless and just a complete coincidence)
I was wondering what could I do before I decide to take my final step towards death, I am ready to die anytime, it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway but I'd like to have a little fun before that happens.
I've been watching a lot of anime, playing some video games and making stuff lately, however, I feel like I haven't experienced something that make people want to stay alive longer
I've already kissed a girl but I never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex, I failed my last two trimesters at school, I could get good grades if I worked a lot but I feel like it's not worth it, I feel like if I work hard or not, it won't change anything, I'm still going to die, I just want to have fun, to do what I want but there is no way I could live by doing the things I want.

1682,"I’m trying so hardYesterday I said I was going to kill myself over a F on my assignment. My boyfriend just ignored me.

Today, he got angry with me for making a joke that I’d leave him for Ellen page. He said, as revenge, that he’d leAve me for his ex. As a joke. Then he did his usual of going to bed.

I’m trying so hard to make everybody happy. I’m trying to get through college, I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didn’t. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and I’m sick of it.

I’m 24, I live with my parents, I’m not able to find a job, and as of ten minutes ago I’m single. I’ve been in college for the past six years, with no luck on enjoying, let alone passing, a course. I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want to have because my boyfriend wanted me to. Throughout the first one, he was constantly telling me to leave him alone. I was constantly depressed for three months after, and he would always tell me to leave if I was going to act like that. The second one, he didn’t do that as much, but I wasn’t as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think I’m ready to leave now. After he said he’d leave me for his ex I just thought... I’ve never thought to joke about that, I’ve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isn’t true? 

So I think I’m done. I’m done trying. I’ve tried for thirteen years to get better and I’m tired. I can’t handle a job. I can’t handle school. I can’t even handle my boyfriend who I’ve been with for nearly six years.

Also my mom and dad is in a different country and I never seen them for almost a year. The thought of my family losing me through suicide is something I also can't imagine to think.

1718,"Anyone else realize how messed up Timmy Turner’s life was? Looking back, this is quite possibly the saddest show I’ve ever watched. 

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. He’s also bullied in school, both by his “friends” and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, it’s everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he can’t show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isn’t because they would be taken away, but because they don’t exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like he’s lost it, treats him like he’s a “not all there” 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isn’t because he just doesn’t like them, but because the “fairies” Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesn’t try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if you’re the parent to a 13 year old you’re not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. You’d only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmy’s case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality. 

I’m never going to be able to watch another Fairly Oddparents episode again.

1721,"How can I get over other people's opinion ? The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide is others' opinion about me !I want to commit suicide for various reasons:
 
  1. I'm in Medical school which I hate. Do not tell me ""it's going to get better"" - It won't ( and either way, I've run out of patience to wait for it ). Do not tell me ""you can choose something else"" - I can't, I invested time and energy into this and I am no good at anything else ( and I'm not brilliant at this either, so fuck it ). 

  2. I had an arguing with my parents. I know damn well that being 23 years old and living with them is a shame, but they just make me to feel even worse about it, even though they know I can't move out, because I have no money. Yeah, I could take out a loan and then spend the rest of my life working like a mad horse to pay back the loan. Thanks,  but no thanks. If this is life, I'd rather be dead and end up in I don't-give-a-fuck-where, whether hell does exist or not, I just don't give a damn, this crap is not worth living. 

  3. I didn't have a great adolescence at all. The first part of it was spend being a perfectionist, emotionally liable pathetic creature that I was, struggling to do well in school, because this was the only thing that mattered to my mom, plus struggling with my eating disorders all the time. The second part of it was me rebelling against my fucked-up family life: abusing alcohol and hanging out with other fucked-up people like me. Fast-forward and I'm 23, being in Medical school, studying things that I don't like, which is not a surprise, because for whatever reason I can't enjoy anything in my life at all anymore ( probably my brain is already fucked because of years of abuse ). 

  So there it is: I don't want to be a burden for my parents anymore and I can't think of anything else to figure out the shit I'm in and I've tried a lot of things. I tried working out, I was a gym member for 4 fucking years, you know what I got ? Even more body-image issues. 

  Also there is nothing motivating about the future either: in this world it's all about making good connections and licking people's asses, this is how you get ahead and so what's the point of it ? What's the point of this whole life , if I don't like anything at all about it anymore ?  I don't like the way things work, I don't like how this whole fucking world works, and because I know I'm not going to be the one who is going to change the world, I might just as well check-out, because I really don't want to fit in this society.

  I want to commit suicide, I just don't want to think about what other people will think after I die. It's kind of ironic, but this is the only thing that is holding me back. These idiots are going to talk about me even after I'm dead and I can't stand the idea of it. So tell me, if you are an average, normal person: how much people gossip about someone after they die ? What things they say about them ? Do they consider them cowards ?

     While I thought I was given time to relax...

     My bladder had something, to extract.

     With the sudden urge to release this fluid...

    I ran to the lavatory with no genders excluded.

     After reaching the bathroom, I shut the door behind me.

     I pulled down my pants, all the way past my hiney.

     I relieved myself in a clear-yellowish like stream.

     So comforting and fresh, just like in a midnight’s dream.

     As I finished It all up fashionably.

1734,"I'm freaking the fuck out. I can't function as an adult.not that I could function as a kid either, but as I'm becoming older my weirdness is becoming more and more of a problem. 

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

1748,"Want to be done with the pain, but don't want to hurt others, and I fear what does / doesn't come next!The title is pretty self explanatory. I have a life that on the outside looks good. Good job. Good family etc... however, it is like a piece of wood that has rotted on the inside and is infested with maggots and termites. 

I have been battling depression and anxiety for years now. I have pissed away a lot of money to make myself happy, but they are only momentary reprieves. 

Honestly, I just want to drive my car to a very wooded and secluded area, take a walk down a long path. Leave said path and find a beautiful spot, and put my pistol to my temple and blow my brains out. Suicide notes and all in my pocket, or in my car. 

However, I don't want to hurt my family, friends, and so and so forth. My best friend committed alcohol induced suicide 4 years ago this past St. Paddy's Day. And it devastated his family, and his friends, and I had to be the barer of bad news to a lot of people because his family couldn't do it right away. I just can't do that to my family, even though they are a large part of my stress and depression. My friends aren't for the most part. I mean I just want this to be over. But I also am afraid of what comes or doesn't come next, and if I am doomed to a worse fate. So for now I won't pull the proverbial and literal trigger. But man I want to.

1750,"I can't do it. Please help.I, honestly, genuinely want to die. The reason? Life's just lost its colors, it's gotten stale. There might be more to it but I'm too tired to even ponder it. There definitely used to be more though. The closest I've gotten to doing ""it"" was to dance on the train tracks, but I only ended up with a slightly bloody hand and embarrassment. I feel like I'm bothering people and I have friends with real depression. I'd feel disrespectful to talk to them about my fake shit. 



A friend talked me out of it once, but I'm too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I'm not fine this time. I don't want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring. I mean, if others do it, that's okay. They deserve help.



If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago, I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it, but didn't want to do it. Now I have no reason to wish it, but I want it more than ever. This is why I can't even ask for help... I have nothing to say. Well, aside from school. That's probably one of the main reasons, but it's so insignificant and selfish that I'd be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal, because it shouldn't be. But it really is. Still, if I don't want help, I want the easy way out.



I guess I have walking depression, but I can still laugh and smile all day. The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife: if it exists, I go to hell and I'm fucked. If it doesn't exist, I just wasted what isn't even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void. I don't feel sad, but I don't want to live either. If you gave me a gun a week ago, I would have pulled the trigger. I don't know if my friends still like me, I'm probably annoying. 



I just want some words of peace, something that can give me courage and convince me to do it, I guess. This is the only related sub I know, although it's the opposite of what I want.

1754,"hanging in there for too longI made some mistakes, and managed to run from the consequences. I ran because I was afraid, afraid of what would happen, afraid of what I would lose. Now I am afraid of what it would do to people I care about. Every time in the past few years I've gotten down enough to contemplate suicide, I've taken steps to deal with the consequences. And every time a new milestone I set to fix everything is passed, I realize how little effect it had, I'm no better off than I was before.

I'm living a triple life. I never tell anyone everything, so at best the people closest to me only have a partial view of what is going on. But I can't do it to them to tell them, that is unacceptable. I will not tolerate the loss, nor would I manipulate the loss away. I refuse to.

But yeah, now my last ditch effort is holding thumbs for the next two hours or so. If things work out, then maybe I will make it through this month, but only to have to face problems next month. Next month's already going to be harder.

If things don't work out. Well, I don't know yet. It's not like I'm going to kill myself, that takes planning and resources I just can't afford right now.

1759,"Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school. My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time. But time changed as I got older... I woke up when I was around 12 years old. It was all about girls, education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it. I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since. Im 21 btw. I was always the ""clown"" who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside. But inside I was crying... I felt alone and unhappy. I had friends and a bestfriend yes. But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games. When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school. They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone.  *I have missed out on so many epic parties,* I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies. As I went to highschool it got worse. I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties. I was still the funny guy though but that was all. During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before. I just laughed with them. But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made. I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced. The normal social life, always spending time with the guys, going out and hooking girls. After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them. Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my life.

Now I am on the edge of suicide. I dont fit in this world. I make jokes of everything and make people laugh. But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself. Where is the joy? Where is my succes? Where is my happiness?  

But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion.... Now acceptance, still lost and no idea where next... Am I happy? Never.

1760,"Constantly feeling stressed, suicidal, and anxiety-ridden. I'VE HAD ENOUGH, SOMEONE FUCKING STOP THIS.So, this is probably going to turn into a wall of text but I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

I guess this started about a year ago when I had my first panic attack at 16. It was horrible, and I've never really recover from that and I've been constantly in a downwards spiral. My anxiety is constant throughout the day, for all that time, never truly giving me a break. Sometimes its manageable when I'm in the my room during the daytime, but anywhere else it's a fucking painful cancer. Even things like movies and themeparks make me want to cry and puke from anxiety. Sometimes I get lucky and I get a couple minutes burst of endorphins, but those are quick and only put the anxiety in the background. Everything is just so difficult to do now.

This anxiety has caused worse and worse mental health. My memory and focus is completely shot because I can't sleep at night (typing this at 3 A.m). I can't even get to sleep unless there's sunlight coming in, causing me to be in a vicious cycle of sleeping from 4 A.M to 12 P.M. I've tried so much to get me back to normal but my body simply will not cooperate. If I go to bed at 9 P.M I'll wake up a hour later in a sweat and bursting with energy I can't use.. It's exhausting and I had it. I just want to have a normal sleeping pattern of 11 P.M- 8 A.M.

My appetite is out of control. I'm not hungry during the day and starving during the night. I hate it so fucking much. 

Over the past six months self-harm and suicidal thoughts are becoming worse. My day is bombarded with thoughts of hanging myself, throwing myself down the stairs, and chocking myself out. Now sometimes when I close my eyes I see a grotesque image. I'ts becoming more and more frequent.

I don't have any friends and I'm going insane from that. My parents are completely emotionally unavailable and useless. Every time I bring it up, I get stepped on ignored. They constantly keeping me on a leash, refusing to let me out of the house until they so decree. I don't even have a single fucking friend. How the hell does a fucking teenager now have any friend how the hell could some be that stupid jesus fucking christ. My only grace is I found a job and can get out of the house part-time. There's nobody around to help.

This is causing me so many problems. Every day feels exhausting and terrifying. Nothing feels real anymore. My emotions and thoughts are clashing like waves. My brain just won't fucking stop being so mean. I'm woozy and faintish whenever I stand up. I don't have motivation to game or write anymore, which I used to love. Everything just hurts me now.

I honestly just want to die and get this the hell over with, I just want rest. I just want everything to stop. I'm so fucking honestly and helpless and so far gone I don't know I would even want to live if I got better. This has been the worst year and my fucking life and hopefully the last.

1772,"Am I alone in feeling this way?Hi all. I joined reddit only to come here and reach out. I feel pretty lonely and I really just want to know if there are other people that have a similar experience. I am not actively suicidal or in danger to myself, but I've been struggling a lot. 

I'm a teenager, and it's been six weeks since I got discharged from a residential treatment program, and I've been having a really hard time. I've never had a ""real"" suicide attempt, but I've been depressed and anxious for a long time, and I've lived with suicidal ideation since I was 10. My family has been abusive in the past. I didn't realize this was the case until very late into my treatment at residential which has been very difficult because I came home with a lot of unresolved issues. 

I've been in every level of care, and because I was steadily declining, I was put into a residential treatment facility. I also needed 24 hour care due to how nonfunctional I was. When I got there I realized that most of my peers in the facility had attempted suicide. I have had suicidal actions, such as writing letters/notes, collecting pills, figuring out ways to end my life, starting to attempt, etc. Ever since I got into treatment, my resolve to actually attempt has gotten stronger and stronger. I'm very afraid that my pain isn't valid unless I've tried to kill myself. That narrative has been cycling through my mind for a few years, and now I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. 

There have been many, many times when I've been actively suicidal, or at least gotten to being ""truly suicidal"", meaning I really, really wanted to die. As in, that's all I wanted out of life. When I was residential I really wanted to kill myself and I tried 3 times, but none of them worked because I didn't have what I actually wanted to use, which was really frustrating at the time.

 The other odd thing I've realized is that I wasn't attempting outside of treatment because I lived by staying in bed all day, sleeping all day, or watching youtube all day. That meant I didn't have to actually think about why I was in pain, so I stayed in limbo of numbing the pain and constantly getting caught in it. I guess it was my only way of keeping my suffering at bay. But then when I actually had to think about the pain or why I was in pain, the suicidal thoughts became rampant. It also doesn't help that when I'm not suicidal or when I'm having a good day, that ""I'm not sick enough"" narrative is there. So when I'm actually actively suicidal where I want to die, that narrative adds even more resolve as to why I ""need"" to kill myself. 

But I'm afraid of being seen as wanting attention. That's the exact opposite of what I want. It's really hard to attempt at home because 1) I don't want my family to know 2) I don't want people to find out and worry 3) I don't want to get hospitalized again 4) I don't want to talk about with anyone, or talk about the emotions behind it. 

It's weird, because when I'm not actually suicidal, I'm thinking all the time about wanting to attempt suicide to prove I'm in pain, or that my pain is valid. But when I'm actually suicidal where I want to die to end the pain, then the ""you need to prove it"" just feels like an added reinforcer, even if that's not the primary reason I want to die. But then again, isn't it kind of fucked up that my baseline is ""I need to prove I'm in pain by risking my life and/or dying""?

I don't know, maybe I'm looking for reassurance, maybe I'm looking for someone to relate. It's odd. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this, and I haven't, so I'm still trying. I'm still reaching out. But it's just so hard.

1777,"Irreversible problemIn general I've had an alright life. I've got friends, I'm generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me, I have a supportive mother and family, I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm, fincally alright off and I had a loving, caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with, as did she.

Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life.

During our two year relationship she'd been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better.
The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times, but I stuck by her because she was worth it. 

Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I'd been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her. 

Since it happened everything has just spiralled. Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me. It's put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live. I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much.

The main thing above all else is how I've lost her and I can't fathom or face a life without her. She was just too special, too loving, too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her. I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would've happened had I just stayed.

I'm 32, I've spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity. It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted.

It's been over half a year since it happened and I'm just getting worse. Even with therapy, grief counselling, medication and endless research I'm not improving. I won't meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare. 

I don't really want to die but again, I can't face a reality without her. I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it, getting the confidence to do it. I get no joy from anything, I just cry and spend all day in bed. Not even sure why posting this, I guess it's just somewhere to vent.

1778,"Pity doesn’t helpI’m about to be admitted to the very hospital I currently work at (though obviously not for much longer). A lady there during orientation said her “heart goes out to suicide ideation patients because y’all there are some people that don’t think their life is worth living and that just hurts my heart for them” and my (internal) reaction being such a person without her realizing was “b— no one said your life was worth living either. I could have literally any life and I would still want to die.” Basically my point is pity is not helpful because we are not less than you. 
Aside from that it really sucks but it’s true even though my specific life is extremely difficult and hard to deal with I cannot imagine any possible life where I would be okay apart from maybe just inheriting a couple million dollars. (Not going to happen any time soon.) 
I can’t think of any job where I would be okay or any way of life where I would be okay. 
I had a meltdown at work Tuesday from severe anxiety and the sent me home for two weeks to sort it out. I have been home a week with no improvement. Tried to find a doctor but they said it will be at least a week and a half for my first app with a therapist and two weeks after that to see a psychiatrist.

care.Note: I have been in a depression for a long time. Opened up about it about a year ago. Saw almost all of my friends leave me, one by one when I wasn't useful anymore. I lost my job, got expelled from university for failing to write my final thesis and had to move back to my parents basement. I had one friend left, my best friend, or so I thought. She didn't stay in contact and neither did I much. I wrote two e-mails but that's that. I had hoped she'd care about me even when I wasn't around to do things for her. She didn't. When I hadn't heard from her in two months I wrote to her wishing her well for the future. I thought that it had ended and wanted to at least tell her that I am proud of her for having finished university and all. She replied that she had put her head in the sand instead of writing me and she was sorry. And then she asked if I had my degree and what I was doing now. And I...well...I kinda broke. I told her that I hadn't gotten my degree because, as I told her, I was kicked out. And that quite frankly I have nothing ""exciting to share"" because I was trying not to kill myself and it was pretty hard. I also replied that I knew that I didn't have much to offer in terms of conversations and that it was okay if she didn't want to reply.

And well she didn't. I don't know, I was probably too harsh to her and there is nothing she can do anyway. I am just a burden for everyone and why would she want to talk to me? It's just hard knowing that apart from your parents there isn't a single person who cares. I guess I am wondering if I should try to apologize, get her a present and ask her to forgive me because I really really owe it to my parents not to kill myself and it's just harder when you have no social network at all. That sounds so technical but yeah I sort of miss her, I mean I miss the times when I was still able to do things with her and for her and I know it's unfair to ask someone to be friends with you when you aren't doing anything for them.

I just don't really know. Maybe I am just writing here so somebody at leasts knows about me?

I asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story.

Then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity, to which I replied ""whenever you feel ready, making you do something you're not comfortable with is the last thing I want to do"". She then asked ""what if I won't be ready?"", I replied ""you'll know when you're ready"".

Then out of nowhere she texted me ""I know that would be a reason for you to leave me"", I replied that I would never leave her.

1800,"A very tough lifeName's Michael, a youngling, 18, living in Costa Rica, University of Costa Rica Law School first year student. My father died recently. My father was my guide, my best friend, my mischievous buddy, we did everything together. He died of liver cancer on the hours between 11pm of Feb 12 and 1am Feb 13, I was woken up by my worried girlfriend (we were  in a call and was woken up by the same thing) and my mother screaming and pleading for mercy
I didn't have a chance to see my father when he was hospitalized up until the day of his death, mere hours before it happened. He was drugged, only way through stop his unrelenting rebellious spirit that prevented him from staying in bed. Only thing I could get to say was that I had finally entered into law school, his dream come true, he was so happy. He wanted to kiss me, but he couldn't, he was too high. I kissed him instead, and begged him to stay still. I promised him I'd tell him more once he was out of the hospital. He replied to me with a particular set of words in Spanish he would always say to me ""ok, Mijo"" high and not willing to let me go but still letting me go because he understood I was uncomfortable. How I wish I hadn't.
How I wish he was still alive, still with me, still smiling and talking to me about his job in the private air charter flights company he administrated
Life without him is so hard, it's almost not worth living

Almost.
I still cling onto my now ex girlfriend. She has BPD, and I myself am not at my 100% sanity levels. She still loves me, so she claims. But during two months past my father's death, I treated her badly. I would be cold and edgy, saying things like nothing mattered in the end not even her, seeking help from anyone and anything that'd be willing to help me feel better, this worsened our situation, and long story short, we broke up. After nearly a year of full commitment, and 7 months of nothing but what we both wanted, a relationship 100% us and no one else, we broke up. I hurt her to the point where her entire body and life tells her not to come back to me. She keeps saying she wants to be better and healthier before we date again, as she also has cancer. A little detail I didn't mention before, that holds some importance. I always tried my best to take care of her as much as I could, even in her darkest times. It seems as though it's an excuse to gwork on herself and become independent and forget about me though. I'm soon to be diagnosed with ADHD as my therapist said I met all criteria but prefered I went to a psychiatrist for a Dx. So maybe that plays a part in the way I see things, and I sure hope it is
But then again
Sometimes she'll come to me and give me all that love, and sometimes it just seems as though she's tired of even talking to me. 
My mother and other family members know me as the smart yet extremely quite kid. Not to make a joke and a stereotype about autism but, you know the kind. They expect so much from me, but I'm failing class, I'm failing my father, I failed to take care of him. My actions got him killed. I could've saved him.
My actions also ended a relationship both parties had invested tons into, and now I cling onto the idea that we will one day be back together, even though sometimes it seems like a straight off lie. But I've lost so much already, I've destroyed my entire life.
If she confirms my doubts and leaves, nothing will stop me from wanting to od, no matter how many things are pointed out, people that love me, things like that. Nothing works, I simply want out, and I don't know why I can't just feel okay again, this year has taken everything from me; even my will to live.",1,,tough lifetimes michael younglings 18 living costa rican university costa rica law school year student father died recently father guide best friend mischievous buddy died liver cancer hours 11pm feb 12 feb 13 woken worried girlfriend woken thing mother screaming pleading mercy didnt chance father hospitalized day death mere hours happened drugged way stop unrelenting rebellious spirit prevented staying bed thing finally entered law school dream come true happy wanted kiss couldnt high kissed instead begged stay promised id tell hospital replied particular set words spanish woke major high willing let letting understood uncomfortable wish hadnt wish alive smiling talking job private air charter flights company administrated life hard worth living cling e girlfriend bad 100 sanity levels loves claims months past fathers death treated badly cold edgy saying things like mattered end seeking help thatd willing help feel better worsened situation long story short broke nearly year commitment 7 months wanted relationship 100 broke hurt point entire body life tells come keeps saying wants better healthier date cancer little detail didnt mention holds importance tried best care darkest times ecuse work independent forget thought im soon diagnosed adhd therapist said met criteria prefered went psychiatrist maybe plays way things sure hope shell come love shes tired talking mother family members know smart etremely kids joke stereotype autism know kind epect im failing class im failing father failed care actions got killed couldve saved actions ended relationship parties invested tons cling idea day like straight lie ive lost ive destroyed entire life confirms doubts leaves stop wanting odd matter things pointed people love things like works simply want dont know cant feel okay year taken live

My Me Mission Services LLC has always been a very personal company that helped individuals one-on-one to improve their lives. Lately, we've decided to open a blog in order to reach and help people on a much more grand scale.

Suicidal thoughts is a real problem that many people face. Over the last two years, we've helped dozens of suicidal men and women improve their lives and reduce their suicidal tendencies.

A huge component of the mentality of many suicidal people is the feeling that they are alone. Many feel that the problems they're dealing with are unique when most are very common. In order to show this, we would like to interview (formerly) suicidal men and women and share their stories in the Stories section of our blog. We not only want to help people know that they are not alone, we want to share real world examples of how others in their situation have curved those thoughts and improved their lives.

You can choose to make your identity confidential in the way you want. If you're in Las Vegas, we can interview you in person and you have the option to have your video interview posted.

Just send me a DM/PM and we can set something up.

1821,"I don’t want support. I just want someone to listen and acknowledge what I have to say.I’m a bad person. How am I so narcissistic but also at the same time such a self-deprecating piece of shit? I’m fat, unhygienic, unmanly and have a horrible personality.

Some people like me and call me their friend. I don’t know if their standards are super low or what, but I wish I had the heart to tell them how much I appreciate the fact they like me. I wish they would ignore me and go for better friends but at the same time, it feels like a knife going through my chest when I see them talk to other people, as if I’m selfish and need approval, even if it won’t do much.

I get jealous when I see the men around me. They’re confident and responsible. I was beaten a lot by my uncles as a kid. I can tell one of them feels remorse over his actions since he’s been too nice over the years, trying to buy me expensive things and whatever. 

The abuse ripped apart every inch of manhood I had. I wasn’t strong, I wasn’t dignified and I wasn’t brave. I’ve bonded more with my sisters than any other men I’ve met in my life. They understood the abuse as they had gone through it as well, however they could be a bit stoic at times. 

Because of the abuse, I’ve grown to not trust many people and be extremely anxious and shy 24/7. I hear my family members, schoolmates, etc talk about how I lack ambition, how I’m too reserved and feminine, how I’m not as good as the other kids. Sorry I can’t speak in a room full of people, sorry if my face flushes red when my name is called, sorry I feel more comfortable being alone for days than visiting some of the family but it’s your fault for sitting back there and supporting the abuse when I was younger. Every time I took one step too far, I’d be threatened as you thought it was a good way to control me.

My father died when I was 4 and I was vulnerable. Beating and threatening me with violence are the two things you should definitely not be doing... All those punches that were thrown, tears I’ve shedded and lashes from your belts were for no benefit. And even then, my father probably wouldn’t have treated me any nicer had he still been alive at that point. 

I’m the runt of the family now. I’m stupid, weak, shy and not manly enough. Why can’t I be more like my fucking doctor aunts or lawyer uncles?! I’d kill myself if I didn’t have two sisters and a few friends who care. I’m happy for my sisters, but their success still hurts...

I needed some time to think about if I was ready to just back in to a relationship and took 4 days to think. During that time the girl got into another relationship.

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend. Despite that we went out for dinner and she held my hand and cuddled into my arm, crying a lot because she wants to be with me but she says 'she can't'. I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me. 

I've waited 6 months through lockdown and covid restrictions for her. I went on one date with another girl but couldn't stop thinking about this first girl and so I told her my mistake.

1838,"Too Scared to Die, Too Tired to Live. (A rant, I guess?)Hey, I don’t know if the title makes sense.. but here you go. You know depression, lows and highs and lows and highs, a never ending vicious cycle. I’m in one of the lows lately. Haven’t showered in a week (usually one every two days is my schedule), house is a mess for the last 2 months (haven’t cleaned once) and I feel truly bad. I don’t want to live anymore NOT because I see no hope for my future (I do, truly) but because I feel like even on my happiest days, I will struggle with depression and even the idea is making me exhausted. Almost like I am completely taken over by darkness but here is the thing.. I will never kill myself even though I want to stop existing everyday. Everyday I wish I wasn’t present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well. Thanatophobia is not only causing me to stay alive, but it is also feeding my depression. I simply cannot make peace with the knowledge of all will come to an end someday. And I will not be the one to determine which day that will be. So, this is not hopeful, this is not positive. This is not me saying “I will stay alive because I want to.” This is me saying fear has a big role in me being alive and it is a type of torture everyday of the week, constantly.",1,,scared die tired live rant guess hey dont know title makes sense got know depression lows highs lows highs ending vicious cycle im lows lately havent showered week usually days schedule house mess 2 months havent cleaned feel truly bad dont want live anymore hope future truly feel like happiest days struggle depression idea making ehausted like completely taken darkness thing kill want stop eisting everyday everyday wish wasnt present world feeling thinking kill etreme fear death thanatophobia brought atheist afterlife concept hell heaven darkness think caused fear death young age panic attacks thinking death ages 910 went away carried adulthood thanatophobia causing stay alive feeding depression simply peace knowledge come end someday determine day hopeful positive saying stay alive want saying fear big role alive type torture everyday week constantly

things are getting worse every day where I live. almost everyone I met is stupid, unreliable and angry. I hate to talking people except my family, in fact I don't even talk with my family because they always find to say things that makes me angry. it just makes me sick. but I have to survive. I'm not working since I graduated from college. I need money. I can't live like this forever. I have to communicate with those people. I have to work with them. even this idea scares me, not like social phobia or something else, I just don't want to do it. it always surprises me that how I graduated from those schools without any nervous breakdown. except the fake friends, I was always alone and I can say that my most beautiful years gone wasted, and it was just because of this two faced society. they were/they are hypocrite and abusive every topic you can imagine. I preferred to stay away for not to get any harm, but it wasn't enough. they broke my heart a lot. and I know nothing gonna change about them.

I know what I don't want to do, but I don't know what else I can do.  even if I decide what I'm gonna do, the place where I live  won't give me any chance. and the time is running out. I'm looking at people around me, on the internet... and they don't think deep. they don't even think. all they do is talking about themselves, talking about their endless problems...

1842,"I have lost my desire to live and want to dieHello, I'm not sure where to start, but I am just going to start typing to put the thoughts in my head down in some sort of unorganized manner.  I apologize in advance for my poor grammar and scattered thought process.  I'm currently drunk while typing this after finding out my ex has moved on to another person.  I'm watching football, and that used to make me very happy. I don't care about it today. I'm severely depressed. I don't want to be alive any longer. The only things that keep me going are the fact that I have a wonderful dog who would be devastated and without a home if I passed away, and my mom would be devastated if I passed away.  

I have no job, no potential employment, about $15,000 in student loan debt, a $223 per month car payment, I'm expected to pay $890 at the end of the month for rent, I no longer have health insurance, and I don't have enough to cover those bills in the bank. My ex-girlfriend who was an absolute gift in my life that I never deserved left me a few months ago due to my chronic abuse of marijuana and alcohol on a daily basis, and I am completely unable to get over it. I dream about her a couple times a week, and while I'm awake, the poor decisions that I made while we were in a relationship are daily reminders to me about how shitty of a person I am.  When I dream about her, we are happy, but when I wake up, reality hits me and I'm sad when I wake up almost every morning/afternoon.  She was wonderful and treated me more kindly than any other person I've known.  On top of that, she is absolutely beautiful from head to toe and inside out. She's the only woman I've ever met that doesn't compromise her morals for other people or situations.  I became too much of a burden on her life, and she left me when she went to study abroad in September of this year.  

I've been thinking about killing myself for years, and I don't own a firearm for the fear that I would use it on myself in a moment of complete depression and sadness. 

Since I was a child I was told that I had ADHD, and I was put on a regiment of Ritalin, Concerta, or Adderall (sorry if they are spelled wrong), and I think that's what began my addictive lifestyle. I have quit smoking, but I drink at least 5 days a week. When I'm not drinking, I often think about drinking. I'm unorganized, have months of mail that deals with bills and unpaid taxes and such.  I'm messy and don't know where to start to fix things, so I just ignore them.  My mother is a hoarder, and many of those tendencies have become my own as I grow older.  I hate that about me. I hate most things about me. I often find myself wishing that I had cancer or some debilitating disease so that I have an excuse as to why I feel as hopeless and sad as I do. I keep everything hidden from my family and friends. I justify it by telling myself that I don't want to be a reason for them to be unhappy. I would much rather see and make them happy than bring them down with the problems that plague my mind on a daily basis.  

As far as the things that make me happy go, they are few.  I have recently begun coaching volleyball for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. I'm not fully qualified yet, so I don't get paid, but coaching is an absolute joy for me. When I coach, all my problems melt away and I'm focused on the issues at hand which are teaching the girls on how to be better at volleyball.  I currently help out an elderly gentleman with his teams because I'm 27 and able to do much more than he is when it comes to the physical demands of coaching.  I am in the process of becoming a qualified coach, but I'm dragging my feet, so to speak, for some reason.  

Today I am thinking about ending my life more than any other.  I have already chosen the place that I would like to do it so as to decrease the shock upon people and family as much as possible.  I have already begun writing the letters and thinking out what I want to say to the people who would be directly affected by my abrupt death.  This post is quite possibly my last outcry to try and save my life.  I have lost every desire to even wake up in the morning. I'm am bombarded and reminded of my problems from financial to emotional as soon as I wake up each day, so that makes me not want to wake up anymore.  

On a daily, and sometimes hourly basis, I remind myself of how much of a loser/failure I am. I have had so many opportunities for further education and employment pass me by, and I feel like there isn't much hope left for me.  I can't make enough money to pay my bills even when I do become a fully qualified volleyball coach so that I can be paid.  I no longer desire to be happy because after my somewhat momentary happiness ends there is always the crippling reminder by my mind of the actual situation that I find myself in.  

I appreciate anyone who reads this as my last outcry to salvage any type of productive/happy life that I might have.  If you can't make a difference in my life, I don't blame you. Most likely I will be dead in a few weeks once the New Years rolls around.  That's my plan at least. 

I view myself as completely undesirable and unwanted from birth to adulthood. I am largely a burden from financial reasons to emotional reasons to the people/family that are involved in my life. 

I could use some help. I want to die, but I want to live at the same time. Life is hard, and I don't know how to function properly as an adult.  If you are reading this for the first time in 2017, then just ignore it because i am most likely already dead.  

Thank you to anyone who has spent their time reading this rambling of thoughts and emotions.  I hope you have a happier life than I have and make more constructive decisions than I have.  I don't believe in God, so I have no hope for the afterlife.  I may fall sleep soon. I've had about 6 shots of vodka since I began writing this.

1847,"I'm tired of trying.I can't make friends for the life of me. I've got buddies I hang around with at uni and thats it. I guess my dumb trigger today was those buddies talking about how they went to a hip hip party the other night with buddy A's friends. Buddy B doesn't even like hip hop, I do and live 10 minutes away from buddy A but they like each other. I don't have that with anyone.

""Get hobbies"" I have multiple social and socialish hobbies

""volunteer"" I have done in the past but with my hobbies, university and work I don't have time at the moment

It doesn't make a difference because I'm still the same boring old me no matter where I go.

I've been to social skills classes, I've tried to invite people out only to receive silence or rejection. I've read book after book and watched Ted talk after Ted talk. I suck at conversations, thinking of things to say. I'm probably an energy drain without realising it. I don't want to wait for ""ThE OnE"" in a romantic sense. I'm lonely and don't want to live like this anymore. What's the point of working hard for money and then Is suicide only a depression thing? Why can't it be a logical choice?

Maybe I'm a damn alien I can't connect with people. Even when I think I've clicked with a person it means nothing to them.

Maybe people can smell desperation but i don't know what else to do. I'm normally one to try to fix an issue instead of complain but I'm done.  I want to spend time with people. I'll probably end it after university so I wouldn't have failed college twice. I want to at least get a 1st/A, go out on a high.

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already. I have to admit that ever since i lost my job, the suicidal thought have just kept haunting me and today after what happened, i feel that tomorrow would be the last day for me.

1864,"I just want to ventI've been depressed my whole life, and became suicidal 2 years ago. I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow. 


She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them. 


So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it.

In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldn’t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldn’t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, I’m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job I’m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so y’all know there are no family issues we just don’t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments I’ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is.

I've been working on wrapping up all of my loose ends, and have been looking for a way to get my partner taken care of without me. Recently, we discussed adding another person to the relationship, and together we managed to connect with a very sweet woman who my partner has fallen for. She is really darling and I am so happy that she will be there, at least in the beginning. I hope that he is able to at least realize through her that I am not the only one he can have.

Neither of them know I plan to take my life. I love him so much and I am so glad that he will have a chance to keep going after I am gone. I know what I plan to do is selfish and destructive but now that he is just a little safer I feel less guilty and like I can finally let go of all of this pain.",1,,found partner new love end little peacefully hope alright post probably post reddit need happens 20 partner 20 3 years love dearly battling self harm 13 having ups downs success lately taken turn worse past year seriously considering killing recently decided best course action ive working wrapping loose ends looking way partner taken care recently discussed adding person relationship managed connect sweet woman partner fallen darling happy beginning hope able realize know plan life love glad chance going gone know plan selfish destructive little safer feel guilty like finally let pain

1890,"I'll never be as happy as I was when I was littleI just don't feel like I see any point in anything anymore if I can't be happy. 

I don't really know where to start, or what I'm doing, but here I go.

I'm very shy and private-I think I always have been- and I don't ever feel really comfortable talking to people I'm not really familiar with. Even online, I'm pretty much always a lurker. As a result, I only have a handful of people I feel like I can go to when I'm feeling depressed. And I just feel like I bring the people I love down all the time. I'm so needy but I have nothing to offer. I'm like a child and I don't understand why I even have the few friends I do.

My dog is dying. He has a cancerous lump that's enormous, and has been growing for about a year and a half now. I know not everyone will understand, and I'm not trying to equate this with losing a human being, but losing my dog is really, really hard. He's been my constant friend since I was 3 years old (I'm 19 now), he moved with me from one country to another, and he's always been so gentle and sweet. I know he'll be gone soon and I'm trying so hard to prepare myself but today on the train I finally just started crying. I imagined what it would be like never to get to hug him again and it was torture. I'm away from home right now so I'm sitting here in my dorm hugging my stuffed animal like an infant pretending its him.

On top of it, my anxiety has gotten out of control. I've always had it but I think college has made it much, much worse. I'm very rarely cheerful. I'm happiest when I imagine what I want my future to be like. Silly things like pretending I'm best friends with Quentin Tarantino or that I write for the Daily Show. I feel like my imagination has been able to sustain me for 19 years but I'm old enough now to realize those things will probably never happen, and right now I don't feel like I have anything that makes me as happy as my stupid Mary Sue dreams that wont ever come true.

I used to want to be a writer but more and more I feel like I have nothing to say, and no motivation to try. Ironically, I really want to write comedy, because it's the stuff that's always made me happiest, but I just don't think I have the ability to make others as happy as comedy has made me. So even watching things that used to make me laugh feels painful.

There's so many things I want to do, but more and more I'm realizing I'm not nearly as special as I wish I were. Aside from being a good comfort to my mom (she's been depressed since her best friend of 36 years died a few years back) there's nothing I feel like I can do. I used to dream so big and for the past few years I've been forced to come to terms with how small I really am. And I just don't see the point of living for probably decades more if I'll never be as happy as I was when I was, like, 5 years old and going to Disney for the first time. I just don't think I'm cut out for it.

I'm sorry this is so long, and I don't really know what I want from this, I just felt the need to write something. I don't want to bother my friends anymore.",1,,ill happy little dont feel like point anymore cant happy dont know start im got im shy private think dont feel comfortable talking people im familiar online im pretty lurker results handful people feel like im feeling depressed feel like bring people love time im needy offer im like child dont understand friends dog dying cancerous lump thats enormous growing year half know understand im trying equate losing human losing dog hard hes constant friend 3 years old im 19 moved country hes gentle sweet know hell gone soon im trying hard prepare today train finally started crying imagined like hug torture im away home right im sitting dorm hugging stuffed animal like infant pretending aniety gotten control ive think college worse im rarely cheerful im happiest imagine want future like silly things like pretending im best friends quentin tarantino write daily feel like imagination able sustain 19 years im old realize things probably happen right dont feel like makes happy stupid mary sue dreams wont come true want writer feel like motivation try ironically want write comedy stuff thats happiest dont think ability happy comedy watching things laugh feels painful theres things want im realizing im nearly special wish aside good comfort mom shes depressed best friend 36 years died years theres feel like dream big past years ive forced come terms small dont point living probably decades ill happy like 5 years old going disney time dont think im cut im sorry long dont know want felt need write dont want bother friends anymore

1892,"Life feels so overwhelming...Hello 

I don't even know where to start, but right now, things are really bad - or feel really bad at least. I'm aware that a lot of it has to do with how I experience it and I think this might make it worse. 

Right now, I have a week off annual leave that I've been looking forward to for months. But now we're in full lockdown again and even though I don't want to go outside (thanks to OCD), it just frustrates me that I don't really have too many options - no cinema, no restaurant visits... I understand it's necessary, but it's still hard. 

I have no family or friends nearby either. Just housemates that I don't get along with very well. Or rather, that I don't really want to talk to as that would drag me down even more.

I have a therapist, but I feel that the quality of therapy just gets worse and worse, we don't really resolve anything, we just chat. Which is nice, in a way, but it doesn't really help in the long run. She told me to contact her whenever I need to get something off my chest, but she doesn't really reply to it anymore, which kind of defies the purpose. 
I know that most therapists probably wouldn't be available 24/7, and that's understandable - but I do miss those replies she used to send, a short text or voice message, sometimes giving advice or even just to acknowledge it. 

She pretty much is the only person I can talk to. My family would just tell me to get my stuff together. 

I do have a best friend, but she seems very distant recently too. Maybe it's the situation as a whole, maybe some external factor, maybe I'm just such a pain? I can't even ask that as I'd be worried she would just sugarcoat  the answer (Or start to feel annoyed if I keep asking why she's so distant/if she still wants to go on holidays once it's safe to do so).

I think the only reason I'm still here is that I know deep inside that I mean... at least something to some people. Probably not as much as I wish I would, but that's something I only have so much control over. I try my best, but I can't tell what other people are thinking. 
(Well. And because I just got that off my chest)

Alright. Thank you for reading!
If you have any advice or just some encouraging words, feel free to reply.

Short progolgue/rant/explanation before going into the problem: It is not my first time writting here but I will try to be short as possible since I had a really bad and am not in the mood for writting. Just to let you know that I am a woman and to give you perspective since most advices here are by men for men and it is very easy to throw around some words when it is all men. Like men have it easier because if they go to the fitness and make big muscles, half of my problems that I have as a woman will be eradicated but I as a woman can't go out there looking like a tall manly monster while men can go away with it. 

I am aware this question must have been asked a lot in the past but what I see is only advice for men, like to ""man up"" and to certain things but I do not have money or resources to do most of them so if you are a man and give me advice give it with a grain salt, knowing that I do not live in America, but in Europe, I am a woman so I can't ""grow balls"" or ""beat up everyone I want to for fun"" or ""walk around freely with a knife or a gun"" like it was suggested in some other thread I saw 

P.S. I am not in high school and it is quite offensive to think I am, so now. I am an adult. Thank you.

The problem: My life experience has shown me that it is foolish to expect everyone to be your friend and to be nice to you just because you are nice. but the solution really annoys me and scares me because I know what happens when I put it to work, everyone avoids me and calls me a bitch, yet it somehow works for everyone else. Many girls I know, the most popular girls usually were really mean, so were the boys. So my nice \*\*\* ever tries to be mean or fight back when harassed and it becomes a really big problem, either the harasser laughs at me and continues to harass me or people just avoid me because they think I am confrontational and problematic, which I am not, I do not like conflicts but staying on my \*\*\* and never calling out people who used to bully me for years has proven to not be effective. They just continue to harass me no matter if I ignore them or call them out on their behavior

My goal is to understand this whole power play dynamic and why it takes place. Does my type of personality attract bullying? I remember having problems with it all of my life. Let me explain why I had this short prologue in the beginning. The stereotypical american online does not care much about the outside world. The laws of my country are very, very different from America, yet I have had people shame me for my problems or give me horrible advice in general or both. No, life is not an action movie and I am not the karate kid, No I am not a \*insert slur\* because I can't beat up a gang of guys on steroids, No where I live it is not okay to take a knife and stab my classmates( This advice was given to me by an american high school teacher, so good job!!!) I always have to explain to my self because most people on here give bad advice but some give brilliant and great advice that works for me. I am not saying all users are like those I gave example of and I have blocked and reported these people. I can write all day long about my encounters with weird people from reddit and quora but the point is for me to get  a good advice and not whine to all of you about each detail of my life. Some males on here can't imagine the female perspective and give really terrible advices and some males on here give really good universal advices that work for me.

I am deeply flawed so I have read books on self improvement and I would dare to say that I have made small self improvement which is better than none

I had a panic attack today and yesterday, was trembling and crying and felt like I was holding a really heavy box that I couldn't let go of. After crying for an hour and a half I seemed to calm down but felt better. I mentioned in my last post that I do not know any reasons why I am alive, I do not speak about my \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* thoughts antymore because one ""apperently christian"" classmate made fun of me after I kinda shared this to her on a school trip

(I have been heavily bullied in middle and high school and have a hard time making friends)

I now have ptsd, am full of shame, guilt, grief and struggle to find any reason to live. I feel ugly and broken beyond repair and am ashamed to go to another psychologist. I feel dirtied and r\*\*\*d and do not want to marry one of those people with the male genitalia or have children yet those who bullied me probably do not remember me and will have children while I will die alone. I just want this to end but now my parents watch me because I self hurt and stopped washing when I was 16 and felt the most suicidal during 10th grade. I still get ""waves"" of desire for suicide but I find it hard to find my purpose.

I try to eradicate my onw flaws - people pleasing, needyness, clingyness, desparation(Out of need for survival, I was desperate for friends yet did not know how to make them so here it is like unwritten rule that if you are alone you will be bullied and I am very vulnerable to bullying and can't deal with it which is why I was an easy target, i couldn't defend my self and no one took me seriously and if i ever defend my self people either laughed or threatened to beat me up. I also used to be overhappy which for some weird reason unnerved people. I am not autistic or on the spectrum but I have adhd, and sometimes my anxiety and adhd, create social problems but I have never been good. 

Half of the things I read about body language and communication skills baffle me and they seem genuienely stupid (like I avoid eye contact cause to me it seemed perverted yet the dumb males think it is submissive and take it as a que to harass me, great job. ) I am tired of this world and do not know what to mold my self into anymore to survive. I am ashamed of the fact that I have trauma and have to deal with it. I have had strangers bully me and laugh at me and even old men flirting with me which made me isolate my self even more. 

Important:

I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE A B TO EVERYONE IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY SELF AND SURVIVE AND SHOW THE DUMB MALE GENDER THAT I AM NOT WEAK AND I AM NOT UGLY AND I DO NOT WANT OR DESERVE TO BE HARASSED AND BULLIED. If I am nice they harass me, if I am mean, they harass me. Like what is the point, they will go to the heartless pretty b anyway, so I stand no chance and do not want my life purpose to revolve around the others and expecting of them to be nice to me. I do not feel like I am safe around men, I feel like they would beat me up, and I see women as a competetion due to the hostile bullying in my past. I know guys are dumb enough to fall for literally the meanest girls when I was in school so I will no longer waste my time on them and just try to not \*\*\* my self and focus on me. I try to develop my hobbies but my mind is plauging me and I feel the need to \*\*\* my self, by either taking overdose with pills or my father's pistol and just shooting towards my heart so I would not miss. Phrases like - OOOh not all men are bad, scare me because it is a risk and 8/10 times guys are horrible so it is not wroth it. I do not want to date, marry, or have children. I want to give up on men and realize this mindset is toxic but do not feel physically safe around those with the d\*cks",1,,afraid life lesson want fail looking advice self improvement characterdetailed specific case read answering small woman people mess mean loudwarninglong tetspeciffic case feeling suicidal ma moment panic attacks short progolgue rant eplanation going problem time writting try short possible bad mood writting let know woman perspective advices men men easy throw words men like men easier fitness big muscles half problems woman eradicated woman cant looking like tall manly monster men away aware question asked lot past advice men like man certain things money resources man advice grain salt knowing live american europe woman cant grow balls beat want fun walk freely knife gun like suggested thread saw past high school offensive think adult thank problem life eperience shown foolish epect friend nice nice solution annoys scares know happens work avoids calls bitch works girls know popular girls usually mean boys nice tries mean fight harassed big problem harasser laughs continues harass people avoid think confrontational problematic like conflicts staying calling people bully years proven effective continue harass matter ignore behavior goal understand power play dynamic takes place type personality attract bullying remember having problems life let eplain short prologue beginning stereotypical american online care outside world laws country different american people shame problems horrible advice general life action movie karate kids insert slur cant beat gang guys steroids live okay knife stab classmates advice given american high school teacher good job eplain self people bad advice brilliant great advice works saying users like gave eample blocked reported people write day long encounters weird people reddit quota point good advice whine detail life males cant imagine female perspective terrible advices males good universal advices work deeply flawed read books self improvement dare small self improvement better panic attack today yesterday trembling crying felt like holding heavy bo couldnt let crying hour half calm felt better mentioned post know reasons alive speak thoughts anymore apparently christian classmate fun kinda shared school trip heavily bullied middle high school hard time making friends ptsd shame guilty grief struggle find reason live feel ugly broken repair ashamed psychologist feel dirtied rd want marry people male genitalia children bullied probably remember children die want end parents watch self hurt stopped washing 16 felt suicidal grade waves desire suicide find hard find purpose try eradicate onw flaws people pleasing neediness clingyness desparation need survival desperate friends know like unwritten rule bullied vulnerable bullying cant deal easy target couldnt defend self took seriously defend self people laughed threatened beat overhasty weird reason unnerved people autistic spectrum adhd aniety adhd create social problems good half things read body language communication skills baffle genuinely stupid like avoid eye contact cause perverted dumb males think submissive que harass great job tired world know mold self anymore survive ashamed fact trauma deal strangers bully laugh old men flirting isolate self important feel like order protect self survive dumb male gender weak ugly want deserve harassed bullied nice harass mean harass like point heartless pretty stand chance want life purpose revolve epecting nice feel like safe men feel like beat women competetion hostile bullying past know guys dumb fall literally meanest girls school longer waste time try self focus try develop hobbies mind plaguing feel need self taking overdose pills fathers pistol shooting heart miss phrases like oooh men bad scare risk 8 10 times guys horrible wroth want date marry children want men realize mindset toic feel physically safe ducks
1900,"Fuck this shit. I'm finally done.I'm ending it. I've been going through bullshit day in and day out every single motherfucking day of my life.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

I always kinda felt bad about thinking about killing myself by thinking my family would miss me. Maybe they will, and maybe my mom will be miserable forever but now that is what I *want*. My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life. She lies to their faces in front of me, and I have to get lectured every time I see them about something stupid my mom told them I did.

Fuck them all. Fuck everything. I want to open up a space for another child to grow and have a decent life. There's too many people on the planet anyway.

1906,"Dreams are stupid Can we talk about how dreams are unbelievably stupid? A few days ago, I had a dream where me and the more athletic version of my sister’s boyfriend from two years ago were in the street in front of my house. It was dark outside and the only light was a dim street light that’s on the corner of my house. We were confronted by a mixed race Michael Cera, wearing a basketball jersey, holding up a sign saying,”I’m not racist”. He then rips part of the sign that says “not”, and as you guessed it reads out,”I’m racist”. He then runs towards us and we start fighting back. Except in my dream, I jumped onto his back to sorta disable him and my sister’s boyfriend is the one beating him up. We then beat him up to the point where he’s a tiny person, and we poke his eyes out. Then all of a sudden, we’re inside holding a tiny, frail baby that looks like it was boiled in water. So of course, I didn’t go back to sleep after that.

1908,"I am nothing. I have nothing.My husband has been having his ""last night of drinking"" for three months. After 3 years of problem drinking. This excuses maxing out my card, his card, spending every dime including change from penny jar, getting deposits back at the beer store - it's always the last night so do your worst, right?

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of ""medical leave"" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys. He drinks until his head bobs around, until he stumbles and breaks things and 100% denies he's drunk. 

I never should have gone to university. I never should have left that shithole town. I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth. I hate my life. I hate every day I wake up. 

I hate myself for not doing it already. I've cut my arms open but never deep enough. I hung myself but not privately enough. I've overdosed but barfed most of it up.

1919,"Low mood from issues at work(Also posted on r/advice)

23, M, UK

Evening all. I’m relatively new to reddit but have been lurking a while and noticed that this sub gives decent advice, and I’m feeling quite low this evening and feel I need to share my thoughts if you don’t mind.

I’ve been at my place of work three years, I love it. It’s the industry I’ve always wanted to work in, the pay and benefits are great and I love the day to day stuff. I’ve attached myself to a group of friends which is great too, but over the past year there’s been a few times where people inside this friendship group have made some comments “in jest” which have really hurt me. I’ve tried writing it off as banter plenty of times, and I know I am oversensitive so have to write some of it off as that too, but especially recently I’ve been struggling to cope more and more. 

Like this afternoon for example; I was in a perfectly happy mood having worked on my own all day, then walk into the office to complete some paperwork before I go home and three of the guys are in there. The dominant influencer of the three makes some comments dressed as “banter”, and instantly I feel a sense of dread. Like someone has pressed a light switch, I feel a warm queasy feeling all over my body and I feel my chest go all fluttery. I struggle not to cry in front of them and leave quickly. I won’t go into the comments made, not because they are particularly nasty or anything but it requires inside knowledge of the job I do and that would take even longer to explain. 

Anyway so I’m feeling pretty terrible about all this, and begin to have violent visualisations where I’m hurting myself, like deeply cutting into my arms or falling from a tall building and my bones smashing. I can’t stop these visions from appearing in my head and I’m almost craving the physical sensation that they depict. I do have a history of depression and low mood which stems from childhood (I’m 23 now).  In recent times these visions of me hurting myself seem to become my default response to feeling low. The violent thoughts soon progress into suicidal thoughts and I then spiral and get more &amp; more upset.

I can’t tell work how I feel because if I admit the thoughts in my head I will be taken away from the work that I love and probably end up being made to go sick which will make me feel 100x worse.

My bf knows I get sad from time to time but I don’t want to burden him with my problems because I’m scared that it’ll put him off (which is pretty illogical because we live together and have been together a good while). I don’t like burdening my parents either because they’ve got their own worries. 

I don’t want to confront the boy because when I’ve told him before that he’s upset me I’m made to feel like the one in the wrong because I can’t handle the banter. Likewise I can’t report it to work because I don’t want to be labelled a grass, and I’ve always believed I should have the courage to confront the person and if I can’t or won’t do that then I shouldn’t get anyone else involved.

I know I’m giving excuses for literally every possible solution, (and I’m sorry about that because I can’t stand it when others do that) but I guess just writing this post is helping to a degree 

Thanks for listening to me, anon internet user. Wish I had the balls to tell someone in real life.

TLDR: Friends at work are saying hurtful things, I’m unsure if I’m being oversensitive but regardless it’s causing me to have violent visualisations of hurting myself/suicide which I can’t turn off &amp; I feel I can’t turn to anyone else in real life.",1,,low mood issues work posted r advice 23 uk evening im relatively new reddit lurking noticed sub gives decent advice im feeling low evening feel need share thoughts dont mind ive place work years love industry ive wanted work pay benefits great love day day stuff ive attached group friends great past year theres times people inside friendship group comments jest hurt ive tried writing banter plenty times know oversensitive write especially recently ive struggling cope like afternoon eample perfectly happy mood having worked day walk office complete paperwork home guys dominant influencer makes comments dressed banter instantly feel sense dread like pressed light switch feel warm queasy feeling body feel chest fluttery struggle cry leave quickly wont comments particularly nasty requires inside knowledge job longer eplain im feeling pretty terrible begin violent visualisation im hurting like deeply cutting arms falling tall building bones smashing cant stop visions appearing head im craving physical sensation depict history depression low mood stems childhood 23 recent times visions hurting default response feeling low violent thoughts soon progress suicidal thoughts spiral camp upset cant tell work feel admit thoughts head taken away work love probably end sick feel 100 worse knows sad time time dont want burden problems im scared itll pretty illogical live good dont like burdening parents theyve got worries dont want confront boy ive told hes upset im feel like wrong cant handle banter likewise cant report work dont want labelled grass ive believed courage confront person cant wont shouldnt involved know im giving ecuses literally possible solution im sorry cant stand guess writing post helping degree thanks listening anon internet user wish balls tell real life tltra friends work saying hurtful things im unsure im oversensitive regardless causing violent visualisation hurting suicide cant turn camp feel cant turn real life

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick.

1942,"Need some help in MS/LA...I'm male, and I live around the Mississippi/Lousiana border near Slidell, and I don't know what to do really...


To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...

1945,"partner threatening to commit suicideAnd I feel guilty and responsible.
The thing is, I convinced my partner to go to the psychiatrist. He got prescribed meds. Everything seemed to be going well, until...
There is this boy that is my best friends for 10 years. There was never chemistry between us, we are just mates. Throughout our friendship he did some nasty things to me, but somehow we always got back.
When I started dating my partner he immediately hated my friend. I told him some bad things that the did to me in the past and it formed an image of an abuser in the head of my partner. The truth is, I should have held my emotions, but even though I tried to explain to him that it's not the case anymore, he hates the friend guy very much. He never openly told threatened me, but after every conversation we have about the friend he gets extremely suicidal. Two days ago he locked himself in the bathroom and later he told me that he held a sharp object and wanted to kill himself, he was very close. I cried like crazy and he told me that he is disappointed that the most important person for him reacts in such way, because it makes him feel like a bad person.
I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose a long time friend and I feel emotionally manipulated. I have not told anyone because I'm scared that my partner will get mad and will do something bad to himself. When I told him I feel manipulated he wanted to kill himself for being a bad person for me because he felt like psychopath and he hated himself for that. On the other hand, I distanced myself from the friend and he is angry at me for that. He doesn't understand why I did that and he feels cheated because our friendship was very important for both of us. So. Here I am alone. With everyone being angry at me, I feel constant guilt and need to do everything my partner wants me to. I love him very much and I don't want him to end himself. But I also don't want to be put in the position where I need to chose between friend or partner. I feel really sick of this all, I have no idea what to do. My partner doesn't want to go to the therapy with me. He also doesn't want to get any more psychological help. I cannot force him, it must be his decisions. I feel so alone.

Anyone has any tips on how to talk with either of them? I feel embarrased that I got myself to be so manipulated and I don't want to admit it to my friend because he will tell me to leave my partner. And I CANT live him. I would feel guilty if anything bad happens to him. I feel the responsibility for too many people at once. I want to see counselor but first I decided to do a research on the Internet and ask you on this subreddit. How to talk with suicidal people?
Is there any solution? 
This situation is just so sick. I'm afraid to tell anyone, because no one will understand. I feel so alone in this.

My fingers slipped and I wiped out and bruised my tailbone. It was exactly what I feared would happen. I got right back up though, and tried it again and nailed it the 2nd time. 

That was almost 15 years ago; I'm 23 now. If someone were to ask me the last time I was proud of myself it would be that day as an 8 year old. I swear to God i'm that much of a loser.

This idea that I can still be useful to others is what is keeping me going. That I can guide others to be successful in careers, or boost their spirit, or help them monetarily. When I'm dead, that goes away, right? So, if I have a reason to live, I think it's to give others more reasons to live.

So I kept a tally this year...

112 kids introduced to STEM in the real world, taught programming, given demos, generally attempted to inspire to study technical subjects. (~80% young women)

10 college students mentored in ""social change through app dev"" projects

41 minority college freshman introduced to career options and demo'd

3 college interns directly mentored

1 lady given a job on my recommendation

1 family member helped with suicidal thoughts and taught meditation

1 friend of the same family member guided to emergency services when he attempted

3 anonymous donations to give Christmas to random families

If I were dead, that stuff wouldn't have happened. I just keep telling myself that and looking for more opportunities.",1,,172 reasons going went years thoughts theyre damn day ive thinking lot id id notes im selfish leave family pain havent idea useful keeping going guide successful careers boost spirit help monetarily im dead goes away right reason live think reasons live kept tally year 112 kids introduced stem real world taught programming given demos generally attempted inspire study technical subjects 80 young women 10 college students mentored social change app dev projects 41 minority college freshman introduced career options demod 3 college interns directly mentored 1 lady given job recommendation 1 family member helped suicidal thoughts taught meditation 1 friend family member guided emergency services attempted 3 anonymous donations christmas random families dead stuff wouldnt happened telling looking opportunities
1981,"21st Birthday.I made post a couple of weeks ago about how I planned to die today. Since then I have had multiple appointments with my uni's mental health specialist; my doctor and a few phonecals from the mental health crisis team. I have, in the last 48 hours, told them that I can assure them I will not go through with my plans and that I will allow them to do some kind of intervention-therapy-something-or-other the day after my birthday.

The thing is, I don't know what I am going to do, but I know what I want to do; I want to take one of my kitchen knives, slash my throat and then start stabbing myself until I exit this world. I want the pain, I want the agony.

1985,"Please don't send me PMsI feel guilty that some stranger is showing some kindness and I can't repay them back.

Anyway, just a few more days. I feel empty. I've given myself the liberty to do whatever I want for the next couple of days but there's nothing I want to do, you know? I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.

In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.

I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.

No, I don't want to do anything about it. I know you're thinking I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't want help but I just want to leave this here like a note of some sort. Obviously this still doesn't explain why but I want people to know I had thought about this for a while and it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing.",1,,dont send psi feel guilty stranger showing kindness cant repay days feel ive given liberty want net couple days theres want know ive given trying finish reading list read sentencesometimes pageand close book bought ve pokemon silver thinking regret buying dont know im typing im bored guess restless bored im probably thinking things againmaybe rope ill buy wont able hold weight maybe find die maybe wont window opportunity etc terms planning dont think constraint firsti didnt want grandma know killed myselfbut recent events realize dont care anymore parents probably hide feel weird like im faking ive thought suicide countless times sad angry im content like im sad angry think suicide dont want know youre thinking wouldnt posting didnt want help want leave like note sort obviously doesnt eplain want people know thought wasnt spurofthemoment thing
1986,"I don’t have anything that makes life worth fighting for.I’m sitting here at a Korean BBQ restaurant on a Saturday night eating dinner by myself.
My plans fell through today - both Plan A and Plan B. As I’m sitting here trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my day, I can’t really come up with anything worthwhile. 
That’s when I started thinking about ending my life. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense to me. I hate being stuck in the same old loop. I fight tooth and nail for change, and I always end up with the same result - nothing.
Ending it all seemed like the easiest way out. Even though my few friends and family would be crushed, I feel like I would finally have relief. When the hell am I going to get paid my due? When will the world throw me a bone for once? Will anything ever go my way?",1,,dont makes life worth fighting forhim sitting korean biq restaurant saturday night eating dinner plans fell today plan plan im sitting trying figure rest day cant come worthwhile thats started thinking ending life thought sense hate stuck old loop fight tooth nail change end result ending like easiest way friends family crushed feel like finally relief hell going paid world throw bone way
1987,"And I'm the selfish one. The asshole he calls me.Mom made me marry him at 17 in Chester, VA.  I gave him my virginity.  He gave me herpes.  We had a quick 15 minute ceremony at a lawyers office.  My honeymoon took place at the Sheraton on Midlothian tnpk.  Special....until he said he took all his gf's there.  A year later we moved in with my Grandma to save money and get a house.  At this point we were the proud owners of a ford festiva, $155 a month.  He worked at the local ford dealership.  Needless to say we couldnt move an apartment full of furniture in that micromachine car.  So he bought an f150.  $330/month.  Why did we move to my G'mas?  I went to see my cousins baby with my G'ma. He got mad and went out drinking.  Drove home down the train tracks.   I had two daughters while living in that basement.  He had 2 motorcycles and a boat and a bronco. After 5 years I got the hell out.  To the second apartment.  I got a job cleaning houses.  I bought me an $1100 1980 something mustang.  We moved into a trailer.  I bought me a new 1999 mustang.  We moved 2 more times.  I got a job driving a school bus.  I went to college inbetween.  We moved in with his mother so I could attend nursing school full time.  Big mistake.  Quit and went to respiratory school.  Moved to the east coast of Va.  He bought a bigger boat since we were on the chesapeake bay/rappahannock river.  I tried several times to buy a house, turn down after turn down.  At one point before nursing school I wanted to volunteer at the resque squad.  He wouldnt allow it.  I would be around men...at night.  So I worked in a hospital full of men.  Things that can be done in a confused patients room.  Woooo Guess who got fired and found a job working at nigh?  You guessed it.  Not me.  Effing hypocrit
My daughter turned into a holy terror.  Didnt listen.  Came and went as she wanted.  Had 2 kids I had to take care of at night.  Had to put up with her shit and the trash she brought home.  They didnt listen either.  I begged my husband to quit his job.  I needed him there with me before I killed myself to get away from the shit.  I hated to come home after work so I would stay with my other daughter at her house. We filed bankruptcy after his heart attack because he ""couldnt"" work.   Finally left the state to get away.  This summer 2019, we were close to buying a house.  Until he saw an expedition he wanted.  What was wrong with my equinox at 191 a month?  538 for the expedition.  I let it known that we would not be able to a house again.  Do you think he cared?  He wined like a damn kid until I couldnt take it and said go fucking get it.  Im living with my mother in law.  I have ALS and I'm dying.  Not quick enough.  I married the most selfish SOB Ive ever met.  I have came to the place I literally hate him.  I want to die to get away from him.
Im not perfect.  The night before we got married I was with my exboyfriend.  Who, after 27 years I found him.  I learned a lot that I didnt know was going on in his life.  I wish he would have talked to me about it.  I showed my tits to a few people.  Some got to play and kiss them.  Few years ago hubs dick stopped working due to meds.  Seems to me IF you actually loved your wife you could make lifestyle changes to get off heart meds or use other means to get your wife off.  So I think he doesnt care.  I got' caught sexting with other redditors.  That didnt go well. I was diagnosed with ALS in the morning and he bitched me out calling me everything he could that afternoon.  I guess having been given a death sentence I forgot to delete his texts.
I want a clock that tunes on the hour and to go to the mutter museum and die in my own house.  Do you think that he would do  either for me?  Nope.
I stay in my bed doing suicide searches online.
I JUST WANT TO DIE AND LEAVE THIS MISERABLE LIFE OF MINE.
I LOVE MA AND PA AND MY 2 BROTHERS
I LOVE MY DAUGHTERS EMILY AND TIFFANY.

1995,"I have called the suicide hotline and used crisis chat a few timesI am looking for a solution, not comfort. The hotline and chat have both only been able to provide comfort, which was useless for me because I have only used logic to justify suicide.


Every time I reach out is a desperate attempt to find someone else that has stumbled down a similar path towards making a real positive change in the world. One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted. 

All I can see that I can do now is to serve an example to not let your dreams be dreams. I will build my plane and fly it, or die trying.

Fuck. Everything is dripping with greed. Spending my life trying to sort out alternatives and lifestyles that benefit everyone and make sense... just to have people look at me like a fucking nut. Apparently not wanting to take advantage of people is an alien concept to this world. I can't find words for the disgust it brings me.


I believe I am beyond help. I'm mostly just putting this here for myself so that I can say I tried. I don't expect a change.


It's scary stuff. I can't talk about this sort of thing because I am terrified that if who I am speaking with actually understands it, they will fall into the same conclusion I am currently at. I'm going to try not to think about it now. Not much use though, seeing as it has been on my mind every day for years.
