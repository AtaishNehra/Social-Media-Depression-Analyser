   'body': 'I\'m honestly in a similar boat as you. Your art is definitely good, and even though it\'s not for me, I can see many people liking it. I\'m going through a post-university depression, and I have no goals as to what I really want to do. I\'ve been drawing for just over a year, and I\'ve been enjoying it a lot. \n\nIt\'s only recently that I\'ve started to worry while drawing. You know, the only time when I could usually not worry about anything and just focus on the task. I think "having a passion" is something of a misleading statement. Sure, you can enjoy doing it, so you do it a lot and you feel like you\'re passionate. Except it\'s not always like that, there\'s days where you will not want to draw, or even question your whole existence like you\'ve mentioned. Passion, at least for me, is something that you build, you literally have to work to get it at some point, so that drawing becomes enjoyable more often.\n\nYou definitely shouldn\'t stop making art, especially if it makes you happy. I\'ve slowed down mostly because I have to get a job that I\'ll most likely hate yet again, and it\'s stressing me out. My life problems spill over to my drawing, and yet I\'m still fucking depressed rather than wanting to do something about it. I don\'t have an answer for you man, I just wanted to share.',

   'body': 'Oh I see what you mean! I have seen that and am actually guilty of it. Actually regardless of if it is a man or a woman, women are going to side with whoever they most sympathize with. You get women who feel bad seeing a guy get yelled at and step in. However I concede that usually girls support each other against men and it is inexcusable if understandable; I don\'t think it\'s a conscious thing, you actually have to keep in mind there are two sides to a coin and if you haven\'t seen the whole coin you shouldn\'t favour the one side. The other side of the coin could be nicer than the one you\'ve chosen without a flip. It is a problem, it does happen too much to be ignored; I think I mentioned somewhere that if you haven\'t seen the entire interaction you should listen or not involve yourself. \n\nTo be honest i think we really do that on purpose, the idea is to keep as many guys out of the fight as possible. I think we do it on a subconscious level because if guys see us obviously fighting it looks bad and can drastically change how they feel about us. I can\'t explain it, it\'s like we just don\'t want to be seen as manipulative and sharp as we can be. It destroys the image of sisterhood, and it makes it pretty clear that we actually can be extremely cruel. Women have a great capacity for mental warfare :) it\'s a tool you either switch on and become the resentfully respected leader, or you turn off and become the doormat of other women.\n\n"they communicate to have their feelings validated by the people around them, whereas us men communicate to arrive at objective truths and practical solutions." THIS is so true!  Women have to slam on brakes and slowly make decisions. Men really needle straight to the point and I as a woman can say it gets annoying because it feels like the important things have been ignored? It\'s important to women to discuss things and find game plans where their feelings and everyone else\'s feelings are satisfied which I think comes from how quick women are to shut each other out from not meeting emotional needs. Example my one friend wanted to drop out of college because it was too hard and I gave the out come to her straight that she\'s never find a good job and she\'d be lucky if she did, she\'d never be able to support the big family she wanted, she\'d probably have to live with her mom because cost of living is high and it\'s even higher if you\'re working at Mac D; inevitably it was much harder to live without a diploma than it would be to just finish our last 6 months. She resented it and felt I\'d ignored how she felt but it was the truth and it was objective; she finished college and is happy she did. \n\nI actually prefer that men are logical usually, as much as it can be frustrating you guys are usually right in the conclusions you make. I actually found that no matter how you feel the end results of a decision are the same so you may as well do what needs to be done. I wonder why men are so logical about it? Is it innate or is it learned behaviour? I think mens psychology is fascinating, and I\'m learning a lot here! Mens opinions are often ignored by women because of the difference in thought patterns, which is ridiculous and petty; though I wonder if it\'s just a case of women hear something they can\'t follow emotionally and decide men are just talking shit and over simplifying? Humans are so weird :)\n\nI hear what you are saying about women becoming irrational, I have seen and done this XD and I can say from my side on behalf of women everywhere that it\'s not to try and throw you off it\'s to try bring you back around to what we want to talk about. We want to talk about how we feel about whatever it is. My suggestion is for guys to say "Okay let\'s think for a minute, what do you think/feel about this? Is there something important here that you want me to hear?" And I\'m not making the dude speak first because I think it\'s his job, it\'s because women who aren\'t conscious of what they are doing won\'t listen until they\'ve been heard; that\'s a conversation to have with them another time and it is a complicated discussion but if you want it I\'ll share :) . The girls then say their bit and you just go one point at a time, repeat things they have said to confirm you understood it right we love that. I\'m also not generalizing or trying to make it seem you have to pander to women I\'m just trying to give a tip for in case you ever encounter a woman who won\'t listen to reason and becomes flustered. :)\n\nWomen shout at men when they feel no one is in control. Have you ever forgotten to do something she asked you to do? And she flies off the handle at you? Probably because she had in her mind that you were doing it so she could focus on other stuff; she doesn\'t need to worry about it it\'s out of her control. Then she finds out you aren\'t in control either and her brain just bugs out for a moment because she\'s switching from "He\'s in control of it, I\'m not" to "Do I have to be in control of it? Should I make him be in control? How? What? Where? Who?" that\'s our mental dialogue and it happens in the space of three seconds. It sounds stupid but that\'s how it is in our heads. It\'s a sudden panic because something hasn\'t happened how we thought it would. Another example is in a simple argument, you are trying to get to the point she\'s trying to build up to the point; she feels you aren\'t listening you feel she\'s acting crazy neither of you are in control and she feels it very strongly. Another one just so we have a broad variety :) if a toddler is throwing a tantrum and in time out keeps calling mom names and screaming at her etc and mom eventually just lets the kid out of time out before the time is up just to make it stop; it\'s emotionally taxing when you should have control and someone else who shouldn\'t have control thinks they have it and tries to look like they have it. We know they don\'t have control they\'re just pretending to scare us off, but we don\'t know how to make them stop acting that way. \n\nSo this is a hella long explanation.....Basically just don\'t let her rile you up, because when you get riled up you just reinforce her feeling that no one is in control. You have two choices; take control or help her take control. You hold up a hand and say you understand she feels XYZ and you will fix it by doing ABC. Or you say I understand you feel like XYZ how can I help you to feel ABC? It provides the comfort of knowing you are both aware of how she feels and you are willing to get the situation in control with respect and care for you both. Make sense? I hope so but if not I\'m happy to try again! :) Women are very introspective and look at ourselves in interactions with people rather than looking at ourselves and other people as a unit which I think is what men do?\n\nWell if I was walking around trying to be a soft, sweet and helpless girl because I think that\'s the only way I\'ll get a guy I\'d be quite sad inside; and to have a guy scoff at belittle me for being weak or false or trying to trap him by pretending I\'m an angel that would hurt badly and I\'d probably spend the rest of my life just being quiet and neutral or I\'d become an assh\\*le. I sympathize with guys, I know why they wear that mask and when I don\'t respond the way they expect it drops for a second; enough to show it is just a mask and there is a guy under it looking to be accepted and just going about it the wrong way. I just feel it\'s not their fault they have to wear the mask and they shouldn\'t be shamed for it.\n\nI\'m really loving this discussion! it\'s refreshing to meet people who are so willing to have a conversation! I hope I\'m not rambling too much, I really am wordy :)',

   'body': 'Absolutely not. A bad coach is a bad coach. They tend to be unempathetic, ignore obvious and serious injury as often as possible, and focus more on the honor of the medal (and, by proxy, their own coaching). All of these actions are objectively bad for the longevity of players, which means less roi for good deals (player is happy w/pay and commitment and the owner is happy with the cost), poorer all around performance because of injury, poor morale, and subsequently less victories.\n\nThere seems to be this bizarre idea out there that breaking people is the best way to get the most from them. There are a few freak athletes out there who only perform better under increasing pressure, but most people don\'t. Most people find zen in the motion while those other players find their zen in adversity.\n\nWith MMA there\'s a lot more "acceptable risk" because of the types of athletes it attracts. While every athlete is willing to put their body on the line for glory (big wins), fighters are asked to risk getting knocked out every match. MMA also has a clear list of dos and don\'ts to avoid unnecessary risk to the fighters. Even long standing martial arts put barriers on what is acceptable during a sparing match.\n\nI think the idea is that you should only be asked to risk your life at your own whim and in the preservation of other life, never in friendly competition. I mean, honestly, we want to see our star athletes perform for as long as possible, so we should encourage proper care so they can push themselves to their absolute limits for as long as possible',

Viltrox make affordable adapters and speedboosters for EF-M and E-Mount. You could use a Nikon to EF adapter to use your existing G-mount lenses too, but you won't get autofocus or IS and aperture control is a bit fiddly.\n\nI'd only go for the Sony if I really wanted 4k. Sure the M50 can do it, but it crops the sensor in a lot and you can't use the DPAF autofocus when doing so.",

I could see things going the route of L.R.G. and 90% of games only having a limited physical printing, and maybe only Sony exclusives getting a more widespread release. I love physical media, but I don't have the money for internet in my neck of the woods  and even if i could the connection is beyond slow. I hate the idea of it, but discs now are already just unlock keys half of the time unless you are going for an indie or smaller, independent title. :(",

   'body': "What made me kinda shake my head, when I did my time they were happy in my state to give that daily dose of Subs, but for myself, dependent on benzos (Klonopin, legally Rx'd), was denied it again and again. I went weeks in horrible shakes, weak, sick, you name it, from cold turkey 3 mg/day clonazepam. I even had family talk to family-friend doctors to see if they could do something. Nah. State would recognize opioid dependence, but not benzodiazepine (as Rx'd) dependence. Even had two episodes of convulsions around the first week, was looked over for 4 hours and sent back with nothing to prevent that. I'm not saying opioid withdrawal is easy by any means, I know all too well, but for me its nada compared to benzo withdrawal. Both suck, one made me feel like I was as sick as ever (opioids) the other made me feel like I was going to and wished and prayed to die (benzos). Opioid sickness passes hell of a lot quicker than the tremors, inability to sleep/eat, muscles tension/cramp, stomach problems, mental rock bottom that consisted for weeks and weeks from benzos. And as soon as I got out, was the first time I'd craved that shit ever, just out of the relief. I've quit after for longer, but after 2.5 months with no real improvement its relapse. Bad shit, detox-relapse-detox, makes you feel like a weak bitch. Not to down play opiates, fuck that sucks so bad. To me tho, opiates had that reinforcing, feel-good 'high,' while benzos never had that, yet have been so much harder to quit. Opiates it was get through it stay away, at least with any regularity. With benzos, fuck, its like being a slave. Detoxing lasting months, making functioning in life x4 harder for that damn long. Both opiates and benzos have caused more shit for me than speed, coke, K anything else, but seems if they're gonna treat opioid dependence so liberally they need to treat benzo (alcohol as well) dependence as such. Nobody dies from opioid withdrawal, though rare its entirely possible from benzos/alcohol. As well with convulsions/seizures the risk of one slamming their head on all the metal/concrete cells for minutes before guards come around is potentially lethal as well. Regardless, being incarcerated is essentially stripping your human rights and making you a slave to the state. You have no say or choice, apparently they worry too much about a person dependent on benzos diverting it, yet they overlook this with subs/methadone. I've seen first hand those being diverted in incarcerated settings.",

   'body': 'I am pretty pleased with a proper response, it actually gives a proper argument. A little frustrating you didn\'t actually address most of my points though.\n\n&gt; Adaptability determining iframes and consumption speed is a bad mechanic, mainly because it creates 2 problems that don’t exist in other soulsborne games. By introducing an attribute for iframes and consumption, devs are enforcing that the base or starting class level of iframes and consumption speed is adequate, but most players should expect to level it. \n\nThis first sentence suggests that there is a difference between previously existing stats and introduced stats. in that "introduced stats" are considered "adequate". This is a clear cut case of Bias as any stat in dark souls as it stands introduced has NEVER been adequate out the gate by design. And people who play the game WITHOUT leveling stats are considered to be making the game as difficult as possible.\n\n&gt; Stats exist so you can influence the difficulty of the world around you, if an area is too tough, you probably just need a few more levels and maybe some gear.\n\nAdaptability does this.\n\n&gt; With adaptability in the mix, if a player feels like they don’t have enough iframes when rolling, or their poise isn’t high enough, or the item consumption animations take too long, they’re now expected to address that by leveling adaptability.\n\nThis is the idea behind the new stats, yes. Strength is there to augment your damage and gear equip. Same with Dex... Funny enough same with Int... and Faith... all of which are arguably much more effective at altering your game play.\n\n&gt; Now I think it’s fair for the player to expect some visual feedback other than the Agility stat (which does have a clear soft cap at 110) for the amount of iframes you get.\n\nI take this with a grain of salt. But I can see the argument being made here. Visual feedback goes a long way. But I have my qualms with it.\n\n&gt;  And as long as their equip load is the same, it’s the same animation for all 3 so there is no visual feedback indicative of the increased iframes. So what influences the different roll animations in DS2? Equip load, but this time it’s for roll distance. This is where the previously mentioned roll classes are implemented in DS2. From 0-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-100, and 100+ you roll different distances, and at 70+ you roll that distance slower. That’s 6 different potential roll animations, so a definite increase in complexity that seems excessive when compared to DS3.\n\n6 different levels of complexity is not a bad thing in my opinion. Especially compared to DS3. As DS3\'s Roll mechanic is the most basic out of all the games. The most easily manipulated. And the very root of the problem when it comes to balance in the PVP side of the game (And honestly practically the main reason I stopped playing it). Due to the basic roll mechanics (And MUCH MUCH higher roll speed) Most weapons get shut down in PVP combat. A major reason why Sorceries in DS2 don\'t work is because the roll mechanic is so fast, and so UNCHANGING that you can even waddle up to someone and fat roll circles around them. 6 different distances change the way each "weight class" physically plays, because the armour you wear alters your effective distance. Mix in the Adjustable I-frame and you have much GREATER control over the expectations the other player has in Combat. DS3 Does not have this. You have SET Frames for EVERYTHING making SET gear and SET weapons the unrivalled best. Theres a reason Estoc and Dark sword reigned supreme. Lack of complexity.\n\n&gt; DS2 gives someone with 85 agility half as many iframes as someone with 92 agility, and ⅓ of the iframes as someone with 114 agility. And as long as their equip load is the same, it’s the same animation for all 3 so there is no visual feedback indicative of the increased iframes.\n\nYou\'d have a great argument here, save for Adaptability isn\'t the only stat that governs Iframes, attunement does too. These stats quickly that changes with MINIMAL investment.\n\nHere\'s a break down:\n\nThese are the iframes (ROunded down) of each starting class.\n\nBandit 5\nwarr 5\nswordsman 8\nknight: 8/9\nCleric 5\nSorc 9\nExplo: 9\nDeprived 5\n\nIf you add 1 ADP to Deprived.\nYou go from 5 Iframes to 8.\n\nThat\'s a 3 frame difference. But lets take this into the Milliseconds, because saying things like "Half" and "1/3" is misleading. 5 iframes to 8 iframes is a .1 second difference. that\'s pretty much the same speed as a literal blink of an eye, maybe even faster. These low-end Iframes not only adjust upwards extremely quickly, again I reiterate from my last post, that almost all stats in DS2 are easier to acquire across the board than DS3. Arguing that 85 is half as many frames as 92 (Which is .1666s difference which is a blink and a half) is extremely misleading.\n\nLet\'s invest in the deprived again. 9 additional ADP, 9 levels. takes you from 5 iframes to 10. only 9 levels. Admittedly getting to 12 Is more difficult. as it\'s twice that amount, at additional 18 adp. but again, the variable ROLL DISTANCE, that DS3 DOES NOT have has a Huge impact on the actual survivablity of Rolling. Roll distance carries you out and away from the hurt-boxes. So having 10 Iframes and rolling With an attacks direction will likely get you HURT. But rolling through and against an attack will see you safe. The lighter you are the fewer I-frames you actually NEED to get through an attack animation as the roll itself carries you away from the Hurt-Box.\n\nSee how suddenly the variable roll distances play a roll? Of course you do, but maybe that doesn\'t matter to you.\n\n&gt; Changing the consumption speed of items like an estus flask really disappoint me as well, because in an online game I like some consistency. If my invader has poured levels into attunement and adaptability, it’s possible that his estus consumption time will make a difference in the outcome of a fight. Not his combat, not his tactics, but the fact that his build leveled up the “heal faster” mechanic more than my build seems like unnecessary complexity that only takes away from what could have been great online combat.\n\nNow this last statement leaves a sour taste in my mouth. DS3\'s super estus heal madness is FAR stronger than DS2\'s slightly faster item use. DS2 has slower filling health gauge, you can literally beat the estus out of people while they drink it. Good luck doing that in DS3. Fast roll away, and chug, and suddenly you\'re in a Sunny-D advert. DS3\'s speed makes Cheese mechanics extremely over-powered and saying DS2 has better means of estus-cheesing in PVP is objectively incorrect. but hey, prove me wrong.\n\nEither way, I appreciate the appropriate follow up, and I respect your opinion regardless of if I convinced you or not. The more Happy souls out there the better.',

   'body': 'Why are you deliberately misinterpreting my comment to supplement your point. i didn\'t say all analog modelling ITB is bullshit,i said DAW developers claims about their summing engine being different and that having an audible impact is "a mixture of marketing and bullshit"i don\'t feel any certain way about anything and i already said i don\'t have an agenda here. I like what i like and i\'m not trying to get anybody to jump ship or convince them of anything/make unsubstantiated claims about the superiority of either. I simply said that digital is finite and is therefore not really geared towards producing non-linearties(not saying it can\'t. I am saying its designed not to) which is completely true. The person who mentioned "analog"summing models ITB seemed to think he was getting something akin to how summing on a mixing desk actually works and it isn\'t. Whether he likes it or not it is irrelevant but you can only sum signals one way in digital,anything else would be considered a flaw. I do feel labelling these plugins as such  is a tad misleading but hey,developers get away with all sorts when it comes to labelling things and making loaded claims to the accuracy of their modeling. You can make a plugin that does a bit of EQ and has a gentle saturation curve and call it a tape saturator. That might pass as tape saturation to most,and on some technical though naive level it is correct,but it is not all encompassing of what tape actually does,but perhaps it\'s just the part you desire and like and consider the rest undesirable.this all really circles right back round to it depends on the individual,their end goal, and where "enough"is for them to be happy',

   'body': "Reading some of the comments, I ultimately have to say NTA. But I do understand why they're a little hurt. A BRAND NEW Audi is REALLY expensive. Especially the a5. Thats an intense car to buy a new driver. I got an 05 mustang for my first car (in 2015 for context) and I still think it was a little.. intense? It was something to get used to and I did get in a few accidents which cost a good amount. Would have cost a lot more as an Audi. (I did also get some speeding tickets, full disclosure)\n\nI dont mean to imply anything by this. Your son could be way more responsible than I was. I dont know you or your family, how long hes been driving, anything.. But generally speaking, responsibility in school and on the road are very different. Your first car gives you FREEDOM and when you're just used to putting your nose to the grindstone, that freedom can be intoxicating and overwhelming. I say that from personal experience and seeing it happen to others. \n\nWhat I mean to say is while his achievements should be celebrated and you are totally justified in spending your money as you like, it would be hard for most siblings to see a $42,000 car gifted and look at how their accomplishments have been celebrated in comparison. Im mostly curious as to what the bio daughter thinks of it, as she's grown with the brother and likely has the best pov. If you had dropped all the money into a college fund or something im sure no one would have batted an eye. But to spend that much on a first car is pretty unheard of, so they may come around but it could take a little time. Driving is something that takes time and practice to really get good at. \n\nI don't mean to discredit his achievements at all tho! Deans list is so impressive and honestly im happy you were in a position to celebrate this so fully! It's amazing, really. I just want to provide a little perspective because I definitely see where the other siblings are coming from\n\n\nAlso: who's playing insurance? Repairs? Having a male driver under 25 on a new audi cannot be cheap! (Im assuming you're usa here, if not, I apologize!)",

   'body': 'I am pretty pleased with a proper response, it actually gives a proper argument. A little frustrating you didn\'t actually address most of my points though.\n\n&gt; Adaptability determining iframes and consumption speed is a bad mechanic, mainly because it creates 2 problems that don’t exist in other soulsborne games. By introducing an attribute for iframes and consumption, devs are enforcing that the base or starting class level of iframes and consumption speed is adequate, but most players should expect to level it. \n\nThis first sentence suggests that there is a difference between previously existing stats and introduced stats. in that "introduced stats" are considered "adequate". This is a clear cut case of Bias as any stat in dark souls as it stands introduced has NEVER been adequate out the gate by design. And people who play the game WITHOUT leveling stats are considered to be making the game as difficult as possible.\n\n&gt; Stats exist so you can influence the difficulty of the world around you, if an area is too tough, you probably just need a few more levels and maybe some gear.\n\nAdaptability does this.\n\n&gt; With adaptability in the mix, if a player feels like they don’t have enough iframes when rolling, or their poise isn’t high enough, or the item consumption animations take too long, they’re now expected to address that by leveling adaptability.\n\nThis is the idea behind the new stats, yes. Strength is there to augment your damage and gear equip. Same with Dex... Funny enough same with Int... and Faith... all of which are arguably much more effective at altering your game play.\n\n&gt; Now I think it’s fair for the player to expect some visual feedback other than the Agility stat (which does have a clear soft cap at 110) for the amount of iframes you get.\n\nI take this with a grain of salt. But I can see the argument being made here. Visual feedback goes a long way. But I have my qualms with it.\n\n&gt;  And as long as their equip load is the same, it’s the same animation for all 3 so there is no visual feedback indicative of the increased iframes. So what influences the different roll animations in DS2? Equip load, but this time it’s for roll distance. This is where the previously mentioned roll classes are implemented in DS2. From 0-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-100, and 100+ you roll different distances, and at 70+ you roll that distance slower. That’s 6 different potential roll animations, so a definite increase in complexity that seems excessive when compared to DS3.\n\n6 different levels of complexity is not a bad thing in my opinion. Especially compared to DS3. As DS3\'s Roll mechanic is the most basic out of all the games. The most easily manipulated. And the very root of the problem when it comes to balance in the PVP side of the game (And honestly practically the main reason I stopped playing it). Due to the basic roll mechanics (And MUCH MUCH higher roll speed) Most weapons get shut down in PVP combat. A major reason why Sorceries in DS2 don\'t work is because the roll mechanic is so fast, and so UNCHANGING that you can even waddle up to someone and fat roll circles around them. 6 different distances change the way each "weight class" physically plays, because the armour you wear alters your effective distance. Mix in the Adjustable I-frame and you have much GREATER control over the expectations the other player has in Combat. DS3 Does not have this. You have SET Frames for EVERYTHING making SET gear and SET weapons the unrivalled best. Theres a reason Estoc and Dark sword reigned supreme. Lack of complexity.\n\n&gt; DS2 gives someone with 85 agility half as many iframes as someone with 92 agility, and ⅓ of the iframes as someone with 114 agility. And as long as their equip load is the same, it’s the same animation for all 3 so there is no visual feedback indicative of the increased iframes.\n\nYou\'d have a great argument here, save for Adaptability isn\'t the only stat that governs Iframes, attunement does too. These stats quickly that changes with MINIMAL investment.\n\nHere\'s a break down:\n\nThese are the iframes (ROunded down) of each starting class.\n\nBandit 5\nwarr 5\nswordsman 8\nknight: 8/9\nCleric 5\nSorc 9\nExplo: 9\nDeprived 5\n\nIf you add 1 ADP to Deprived.\nYou go from 5 Iframes to 8.\n\nThat\'s a 3 frame difference. But lets take this into the Milliseconds, because saying things like "Half" and "1/3" is misleading. 5 iframes to 8 iframes is a .1 second difference. that\'s pretty much the same speed as a literal blink of an eye, maybe even faster. These low-end Iframes not only adjust upwards extremely quickly, again I reiterate from my last post, that almost all stats in DS2 are easier to acquire across the board than DS3. Arguing that 85 is half as many frames as 92 (Which is .1666s difference which is a blink and a half) is extremely misleading.\n\nLet\'s invest in the deprived again. 9 additional ADP, 9 levels. takes you from 5 iframes to 10. only 9 levels. Admittedly getting to 12 Is more difficult. as it\'s twice that amount, at additional 18 adp. but again, the variable ROLL DISTANCE, that DS3 DOES NOT have has a Huge impact on the actual survivablity of Rolling. Roll distance carries you out and away from the hurt-boxes. So having 10 Iframes and rolling With an attacks direction will likely get you HURT. But rolling through and against an attack will see you safe. The lighter you are the fewer I-frames you actually NEED to get through an attack animation as the roll itself carries you away from the Hurt-Box.\n\nSee how suddenly the variable roll distances play a roll? Of course you do, but maybe that doesn\'t matter to you.\n\n&gt; Changing the consumption speed of items like an estus flask really disappoint me as well, because in an online game I like some consistency. If my invader has poured levels into attunement and adaptability, it’s possible that his estus consumption time will make a difference in the outcome of a fight. Not his combat, not his tactics, but the fact that his build leveled up the “heal faster” mechanic more than my build seems like unnecessary complexity that only takes away from what could have been great online combat.\n\nNow this last statement leaves a sour taste in my mouth. DS3\'s super estus heal madness is FAR stronger than DS2\'s slightly faster item use. DS2 has slower filling health gauge, you can literally beat the estus out of people while they drink it. Good luck doing that in DS3. Fast roll away, and chug, and suddenly you\'re in a Sunny-D advert. DS3\'s speed makes Cheese mechanics extremely over-powered and saying DS2 has better means of estus-cheesing in PVP is objectively incorrect. but hey, prove me wrong.\n\nEither way, I appreciate the appropriate follow up, and I respect your opinion regardless of if I convinced you or not. The more Happy souls out there the better.',

   'body': 'Why are you deliberately misinterpreting my comment to supplement your point. i didn\'t say all analog modelling ITB is bullshit,i said DAW developers claims about their summing engine being different and that having an audible impact is "a mixture of marketing and bullshit"i don\'t feel any certain way about anything and i already said i don\'t have an agenda here. I like what i like and i\'m not trying to get anybody to jump ship or convince them of anything/make unsubstantiated claims about the superiority of either. I simply said that digital is finite and is therefore not really geared towards producing non-linearties(not saying it can\'t. I am saying its designed not to) which is completely true. The person who mentioned "analog"summing models ITB seemed to think he was getting something akin to how summing on a mixing desk actually works and it isn\'t. Whether he likes it or not it is irrelevant but you can only sum signals one way in digital,anything else would be considered a flaw. I do feel labelling these plugins as such  is a tad misleading but hey,developers get away with all sorts when it comes to labelling things and making loaded claims to the accuracy of their modeling. You can make a plugin that does a bit of EQ and has a gentle saturation curve and call it a tape saturator. That might pass as tape saturation to most,and on some technical though naive level it is correct,but it is not all encompassing of what tape actually does,but perhaps it\'s just the part you desire and like and consider the rest undesirable.this all really circles right back round to it depends on the individual,their end goal, and where "enough"is for them to be happy',

I do things that I enjoy - going for walks, cooking, reading etc, and I have a good friend network and have recently changed jobs (because my old one made me unhappy) but I worry that it is just a mind over matter problem.

   'body': 'Hey! I am the author of the post you are responding to (you CAN\'T be 100% happy without some form of female interaction).\n\nIf you find yourself being happier without women and you have never ever felt the urge to have female interactions of any kind, then more power to you. \n\n&gt;I’m sorry but this is wildly inaccurate. A want is not a need. There are many things I want, that I am better off not having. I want a life free of responsibility. I want to be hedonistic. I want to be a vigilante and right the wrongs of the world. But often in life controlling your urges is the better path, and teaches you to be a better, calmer, more considerate, man.\n\nUnfortunately, as human beings and men, on average we are built to crave and need some form of human physical interaction, in particular with the opposite sex.\n\nNow, just to be clear, you absolutely do NOT need to cohabitate, marry, "give expensive gifts" (like someone wrote below), have children, or bend your life to accomodate a woman.\n\nBy getting some form of female interaction I am referring to casual sex, hookers, short term flings, and yes maybe even long term relationship in those rare cases in which you set the conditions from the start.\n\nWhy do I bother saying this? Would not be better to just be strong and avoid women?\n\nNot admitting to youself you have those needs is extremely dangerous. We men often think we should just be strong and deal with things in an absolute way, but it is a risky approach. If you don\'t allow some form of female validation in your life, and go monk mode long term, I am pretty sure sooner or later you\'ll end up start craving women desperately once you experience a down period.\n\nAnd as you\'ll have ignored your needs for too long, that\'s when you see men getting in with single moms for a crumble of pussy. You\'ll be starving.\n\nYou can believe what you want, in my experience if you fight or ignore a need for too long, you\'ll end up not thinking straight when you\'re not 100% vigilant. \n\nI think it is much smarter to seek casual sex and flings for your validation needs and keep yourself satisfied, instead of bashing youself to then risk going dumb mode once you can\'t keep up with suppressing your needs anymore.\n\n&gt;"I encourage people to not fall into the pit of thinking they can or should at all cost abstain from heroin and porn. You can still allow yourself to get a few more hits and enjoy the high."\n\n&gt;This is why so many people fap to porn and get addicted to drugs. They need to justify their urges by telling people not to go to extremes.\n\n&gt;If you need female interaction to be happy you can do that but stop telling other men that they must have females in order to be happy. I would rather isolate myself because you can\'t get hurt. It\'s like telling Nofappers that they can\'t be happy without fapping to porn.\n\nYou can\'t compare hard drugs to sex.\n\nSex and female validation is like eating sweet food. \n\nYes, not everybody likes sweets just like not every man needs female validation the same way or at all. But how many people really don\'t want or need some sweets from time to time to feel happy?\n\nSweets are fine in moderation, eat too much of them and you\'ll get diabetes.\n\nYou can say you won\'t be eating sweets anymore and that\'s okay. But if you do crave sweets like most people do, then what do you do to make sure you don\'t go overboard with sugar? \n\nWell, in that case you simply allow yourself to have a sweet from time to time. You can say, "I will only eat sweet on sunday and not the rest of the week".\n\nWhat will happen? If you are disciplined, the idea of being allowed to eat sweet on sunday will not only make you happier and more balanced mentally, because you\'ll never feel starved in your needs, but it will also motivate you and keep you vigilant on how much sweets are to be taken in small portions to be truly enjoyed.\n\nThe alternative you are proposing is canceling sweets from your diet completely, it may work, but be aware it is probable sooner or later, on a day you are very sad or depressed, you\'ll end up eating a whole cake out of desperation and hunger.\n\nThe analogy doesn\'t stop here. If you know you tend to overeat sweets (tend to be a simp) then you can just choose to have only low sugar sweets (casual flings) and stop when high sugar sweets are presented to you (say no to marriage).\n\nHope this helps.',

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMobile. Long. Sorry. Also this happened today so might be a bit all over. I apologize. \nMay (18f) has three very well off adults paying for all her stuff. She never has to worry about ANYTHING. She complains all the time when she can’t figure adult stuff out (taxes, how to call the bank, make an appointment, etc.) she needs a hand every damn second.\n\nMe, I’m the opposite. Since I was 14 I was in and out of the house, and kicked out at 17.  I didn’t really have the best family. No birthdays, holidays, etc. lost about 7 homes due to a dead beat father who didn’t want to pay child support. My mom refused to help with anything.I said fuck it and figured stuff out along the way. \n\nMAY CANT DO ANYTHING. She just complains and complains. To me. She can’t get stuff done because “working only two days a week and being enrolled in college (school hasn’t started yet) is very hard. Paying for shit is hard (well, duh) and I want my own place but I refuse to have roommates.” (Doesn’t seem possible for an 18 year old who barely makes $400 a month) \nIt’s been stressful and it hurts because she knows what I’ve been through but she takes everything for granted and can’t sympathize so it doesn’t matter in her mind. \n \nWell. Things are better for me. I found the best bf in the world, we live together, we work the same hours (both 40+ a week) and things are amazing. Recently May has been very jealous. Basically upset that I have my life figured out and I’m happy with my bf, and moving to a new state. Today she went on a huge rant. Basically comparing that her mom won’t help her, her 20 yr. old brother is still living there, and she doesn’t have money. I told her, bluntly.\n\n“I know how to do things because I had no one and just decided to not cry about it and figured it out. I’ve told you how when you had questions you just didn’t want to actually do it. I have a bf because I came out of my shell and decided to go out and do things instead of sit in my room and complain about not doing anything with my life. I have money because I bust my ass and work full time. Buy what I need nothing more, and put most of it into savings. I pay for my own shit and have been since I was 16. Yes I have my own place, but guess what, I have to deal with an un-fucking-bearable roommate who likes to stir shit with my bf and I. You need to fucking grow up, I’m your friend, yes you can rant to me but the is getting to be too much. 2 years, it’s been the same problem. I don’t need this negativity, I give you solutions every time but you IGNORE THEM. I’m being harsh because I’m trying to get it through your head that you actually have to be a goddamn adult.” \n     She lost it and I think a ruined an 8 year relationship, and now a mutual friend thinks what I said was a huge dick move. May isn’t responding and now I feel like what I said was probably an asshole move. \nAITA...?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I look at your feet and go up, the joy I get from looking your feet diminishes immediately". I was 19 back than when we met and dumped his ass eventually 🙏 \n\nOnly when I discovered Kibbe I realised being "small, delicate but fleshy" is a legit thing. I always thought "you are small, if only you ate less and exercised rigorously you could honour your frame what is wrong with you?" But now I simply wear frilly wrap dresses instead of trying to fit into SG stuff I feel so comfortable, happy and sexy\n\nI',

I’ve smoked weed almost everyday since then. Some days I don’t. Some days I smoke more. Some days a couple hits. Other days nothing but typically I’ll smoke a few times a day just a couple quick hits each time. \nI was helping my bf write some music when I noticed the weed shop next door would close soon so I told him I was gonna go get some real quick. \nInstantly his mood went from happy to something close to naggy and not wanting me to go. He started saying I’m obsessed with weed and then started talking shit to me about vices I have already overcome... he does this often, like degrades me for some reason and just talks shit and brings up exes and my parents and everything trying to hurt me with his words. He talks endlessly and barely lets me speak and when I do speak something of truth or tell him he’s making stuff up he won’t hear any of it. He’ll throw a blanket over his head and tell me to get the fuck out. Lol. He has a long history of being super feisty and spicy and then later on saying sorry. I’m getting really sick of it tbh.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

   'body': '\nAs of today, 07/21/2020, r/bbw_chubby will no longer be allowing selling posts.  This was not an easy choice to make, but this sub was never meant to be a seller subreddit.  At least 50 percent of posts are now seller posts, and many new users are sellers.  We hope that women will continue to post here, for no other reason than it makes them happy - that is what this sub was always meant to be, a home for women to share pictures of their larger bodies, of all shapes and sizes.  We understand that there will be a bit of a transition period here, and hope everyone understands this decision.\n\nOn a more positive note, r/bbw_chubby will now be allowing art posts from users.  These art posts can be drawings/sketches, paintings, sculptures, digital art, etc.  This art can be made by the users, or can be simply art that they find beautiful - as long as it\'s credited properly in this case.  The main rules for this new type of submission are as follows...only high quality art (no doodles for instance), art must be of larger women (from chubby and up), credit must always be given, and photos run through one of the many "art" apps that exist will not be considered art.  Men or women can post art to the sub, as long as it follows these rules - I\'m hoping this will go well, have fun everyone!  Any questions or concerns, message me via modmail :) \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wanted it to be at least as dark as a brand I purchased before. You can figure out the math used to add enough to get to a percentage like 5 to 10%, maybe 7 percent, whatever. Its good at making hair grow from what I can tell, though I am skeptical its not a placebo on the eybrows. I should continue using it and see if I see a difference in pictures. I am very happy with the results of my face skin lately. I have noticed dramatic lifts in the eyelids, much less inflammation around the eyes, a younger look. My wife is very impressed and consistently notes that I look younger now. She tells me often now that I dont look my age. The benefits GHK-cu offers are really great regardless of how well it makes hair grow, which I think it does... but I am not the most sure about positive results on the facial hair. I do think you should look into it more for other benefits and see what ya think!',

   'body': 'We got a new Bosch recently where the door opens automatically. Every time I use it, I say out loud to anyone listening how happy I am that we got it. Our old one wasn’t “bad”, I just felt like unloading it was a nightmare with the silverware rack that hung on the door and fell off all the time.\n\nNot sure what model number, but it was around $800 at Lowe’s and we got it on sale around May for $699 or so, which was still a little higher than one we initially liked. My husband is super cheap, but I told him about the door automatically opening at the end to help dry dishes and he was cool with paying a little more. We used to open the door manually because we knew our dishes wouldn’t dry even with heat dry on in our last dishwasher. The new one—they’re almost always 100% dry when I go to put them away. Maybe...I mean maaaybe, a couple plastic lids are wet or something, but nothing like how we used to let them sit on the counter to continue drying until someone would finally put them away. Doing dishes is an ongoing thing, but there’s nothing worse than walking into the kitchen and remembering how crappy your dishwasher is at drying. Ooh, how the resentment builds.\n\nAs far as the Bosch, it took about two weeks to figure out the perfect placement of silverware on the top third rack. But now it’s so organized, if they’re put in correctly, I just grab a handful of forks, spoons, etc. and place them in their respective spots in the drawer. LOVE IT. It used to be that we put the silverware down in the rack wherever there was room and you had to sort before putting them away. It’s so much more efficient now. You can also put some utensils, lids, and other small items on that rack. It literally takes me about three or four minutes to unload the whole dishwasher now. \n\nWe use a lot of large metal cups here in FL because they keep ice for days and we used to put them on the top shelf of our old dishwasher. But with the third rack now, they don’t fit. This is where the mind shift came in because now, we simply put them on the bottom. Larger, short items that used to go on the bottom, like mixing bowls, now go on the top rack. It just works. Took us a couple times to re-train the brain to the new placement, but I like it so much better.\n\nThe only drawback I can tell so far is that it does get an odor in it when the door’s closed, almost like it’s building its own weather system in there with high humidity. But by having a steel interior, my husband says that means it’s working and sealed properly when the door is shut. Never had this issue before, but always had plastic interiors, and they did mold, so I’ll take musty over mold any day.\n\nWe tested it a lot in the beginning with leaving food caked on and I was amazed at how well it all came off in the new dishwasher. We did hit a limit at one point though and two bowls came out with stuff still on them, but I don’t remember what it was. Maybe dried rice.\n\nOverall, we’re extremely happy with this thing. Whisper quiet with the red dot on the floor so you know it’s on. I use CR for everything, too, and that’s what led me to our Bosch. \n\nCoincidentally, our cats would stare at the laser on the floor when its on, waiting for it to move in the beginning. Haha\n\nNever thought I could talk so much about a dishwasher, but of course, it deteriorated into talking about cats. Darn internet.',

   'body': 'Just lost my old boy this last weekend man.  He was nearly 14.\n\nHe died in his sleep, but I have had 2 of my own put to sleep in the past 5 years (old age and cancer, like your good girl), when you add in my customers dogs that I go along with to support the customer it is closer to 20 dogs in 5 years, and it never gets easier.  \n\nEver.\n\nBut it is the right thing to do for them when they are in pain and too tired to carry on.\n\nThis poem helped me a bit, and I am not usually keen on poems, but sometimes they can speak to us:\n\nIf it should be that I grow weak\n\nAnd pain should keep me from my sleep;\n\nThen you must do what must be done,\n\nFor this last battle can’t be won.\n\nYou will be sad, I understand;\n\nBut don’t let grief then stay your hand.\n\nFor this day more than all the rest,\n\nYour love for me must stand the test.\n\nWe’ve had so many happy years;\n\nWhat is to come can hold no fears.\n\nYou don’t want me to suffer so\n\nThe time has come, please let me go.\n\nTake me where my needs they’ll tend,\n\nBut please stay with me ‘til the end\n\nTo hold me close and speak to me\n\nUntil my eyes no longer see.\n\nI know in time you will agree,\n\nIt was a kindness done for me.\n\nAlthough my tail its last has waved,\n\nFrom pain and suffering I’m saved.\n\nPlease do not grieve that it was you\n\nWho had this painful thing to do.\n\nWe’ve been so close, we two, through the years;\n\nDon’t let your heart hold any tears.\n\n~ Author Unknown\n\nThe advice in there is solid.\n\nGo with your pet, hold your pet when they give the injection, cry as much as you need to, for as long as you need to, ask someone to come with you, pick someone who will be ok with you sobbing ad dripping snot everywhere, it can happen. \n\nContact the pet crematoriums now, before she goes.  Find one that is not going to rip you off.\n\nIn the UK often people are hit with £1000+ bills, but decent places that are not based on ripping people off charge about £200 for a large breed of dog.\n\nThe place I use has no special charges, you get your animal back, a nice (simply carved with a few flowers) box and a brass name plate for very affordable prices.\n\nSome places charge extra to ensure you get your pets remains back, which I think is immoral.\n\nAnd how to deal in future?\n\nOne day at a time man.\n\nFeel free to be sad, do not let sadness overwhelm you too much.\n\nI always own more than one dog now, since it is easier to continue if you have to get up and take the other dogs out, perhaps some volunteering at an animal shelter might help you in a similar way?\n\nI personally would be getting another dog ASAP, you can *never* replace a pet, but you can have another pet fill you up with love, and the loss will strike you a little less hard if you have another waggy tail and licky tongue to help you continue.\n\nAll the best man, feel free to PM me for more info etc, I will even do some link hunting if you PM me the State/Country you are in, looking for pet crematoria is a sad job and I would be honoured to lift that burden for you for a bit if it will help you.\n\nSorry for you loss dude.\n\nTake care of yourself too, remember to drink extra, you will lose a lot of water through tears!',

   'body': '&gt;I do feel I have 100% will to change someone because I have been able to 100% of the time. Not once has it not worked out.\n\nThat\'s because both of your states were compatible and not because everyone is your puppet. All the other people in your life are as real and as valid as you. And you reflect each other in all sorts of ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you quote something from Neville that states if a person doesn’t match your state they fall away? I have read plenty of neville (especially his last few books) but it has never occurred to me EIYPO is ever this way...He clearly changed his mind on this after.\n\nSpecifically from Neville, I can\'t. I simply don\'t remember his exact words since it\'s been 2,5 years since I last read him. I moved on to other authors since.  However, I don\'t believe he changed his mind; instead I believe he went deeper. Sometimes, a SP is not the END, but the how, and this distinction is not always obvious to our perception.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;2nd thing I suppose, based on this, we do not truly have control of the outcome we want to have in life, is that what you believe? That you leave it up to “state” or universe will decide what’s best for you? \n\nDepends what you mean by the outcome. We are truly powerful and we get to decide for ourselves, I\'ve experienced this plenty of times although I still have my own struggles  But, I repeat, sometimes we confuse the outcome for the how simply because that\'s all we can understand at the particular moment. Besides, minds change. Everything changes. Have you ever looked back at some of your choices and thought " Gosh, what was I thinking?\'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So your only desire should be to be blessed and happy and however your life takes you there you should be satisfied?\n\nNo, by all means have all sorts of desires. Desires are the spark that ignites growth and evolution. What I am saying is that A STRONG SELF ESTEEM and an AMAZING SELF IMAGE WILL GIVE BIRTH TO EQUALLY AMAZING DESIRES while a not so great self image will bubble into misleading desires.',

Normally I wouldn\'t be mad at something like this but I felt like my privacy was invaded, I had a girl over and this was the time he decided to drop by and yes I know I could have locked my door but we were into it and I forgot. \n\nAnd he opened the door and walked in and I assume looked around for a bit since it took a while before he found my bedroom and as he walked in my room I had literally just finished if you get my meaning. And my dad saw my jizz face which made me extremely uncomfortable for obvious reasons he just said oh and closed the door and the girl I was with was like "who tf was that" and I said he\'s my dad. So we immediately get dressed and she rushes out my door my dad was laughing and I got mad and yelled at him I said what the fuck are you just barging into people\'s places what the fuck is wrong with you. \n\nHe got pissy and he said that I said he could come over, and I said yeah I did but not announced and he said he didn\'t think I was this much of a jerk. And my mum even called saying I shouldn\'t have cussed out my dad like that and now I\'m wondering if I was being too harsh \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Karen is slur and anybody who uses it is prejudiced. You people wouldn\'t understand how hard it is to raise a family under such constant harassment I want to speak to the manager at JadGex or whatever and find out what is so funny about making a videogame that makes fun of all women using such a harmful stereotype. Women who you call Karens are in actuality successful women sweetie. I have a loving husband and 5 beautiful children who I have raised into better people than you\'ll ever be. Don\'t you dare bring my kids into this! Breydon and Kashton have a gluten sensitivity and if you use that against them then you are a pitiful person who attacks people for having a disability. If you don\'t remove this I\'m going to see you in court. I\'ll sue every penny out of you for making such an offensive image. I\'m serious! My husband plays pickleball with a VERY good lawyer who is going to sue your ass for defamation and fraud. I\'ll throw in assault too because I know they\'ll believe me. Maybe you think I\'m "privileged" but in reality I just made better life decisions than you. People like me have nice homes and lives and people like you should be honored to serve us. If I tell you that you\'re doing a terrible job, you should be happy that I just pointed out your flaws. Maybe next time you\'ll improve. You should thank me. My hair doesn\'t even look like that in the picture. My highlights are lighter than that, because I can afford to go to an expensive salon where they can do a proper job. You couldn\'t even do that right. You tried so hard to make fun of me and failed. I hope your happy with the damage you\'ve done to my family. Braylyn has anxiety which means your little "meme" could set off one of her panic attacks. That\'s manslaughter! She is a sensitive angel who can\'t handle the stress from awful people like you in her life. I\'ve already called the internet police to take down this picture. The FBI and CIA and homeland security are all going to receive a tip about a TERRORIST who puts this vile material on the internet. You are sexist, anti-while, and elitist. My husband doesn\'t work all day just so I can get attacked like this. My life is actually more stressful than you can possibly believe. I worked hard to get a successful job at my father\'s business, something that you would not understand. I earned the right to be where I am, so someone like you who thinks they can dress me up like a tennis ball with 4 arms honestly doesn\'t affect me at all. I\'m not even offended. You are just a pathetic excuse for a person. I\'ll sue you. I know the owners of Reddit. You people don\'t deserve to use the internet.',

Progress photos, I'm more than happy to share. \n\nMy skin goals is 'acne and oil management', and I seek out products that work for redness and oil reduction, as well as products for sensitive skin.\n\n2. **Full skincare routine (AM and PM) which includes all products pictured and your reason for using them**  \n\nDaily:\nAM.\n\nWash with GLAMGLOW cleanser, followed by Acnecide facewash. Apply The Ordinary Niacinamide and Squaline, as a leave-on product.\n\nPM\nCleanse with Cerave oily skin cleanser, and apply Acnecide 5%\n\nWeekly/every few days:\n\nGlamglow Supemud face mask.\nThe Ordinary BHA skin peel.\n\nThe aim of this routine and products is to reduce acne symptoms. Acnecide (BP 5%) I use under medical advice, but I find too harsh for daytime wear. The Ordinary products help with my overall skin condition, and seem to improve my complexion.\n\nI've only recently started using GLAMGLOW from a friend's recommenation : previously I was using Aztec Clay &amp; Cider Vinegar, which was far too harsh for my skin.\nCerave I've had very good experiences with as being a good, all-round wash and cleanser (and not very pricey).\n  \n\n  * Full names of each product (&amp; Mini review)\n\nThe Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and zinc 2%\n\nDream product! Works under makeup, goes on smooth, really helps with redness and inflammation. 10/10 recommend.\n\nThe Ordinary Plant Derived Squaline\n\nNot a massive fan of this, but definitely does the job of moisturizing and keeping my face healthy. Especially good for lips, and it doesn't aggravate my skin like most moisturizing products. However, it does take a while to sink into the skin, and you end up with an oily surface layer if you're not careful.\n\nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\n\nI love this! I had to build up to use this for 10mins, but I've noticed a massive improvement in my skin texture since using this product. It is uncomfortable to use however, and you need to be really cautious as it's a strong product.\n\nGlamglow SUPERMUD (Mini Pot)\n\nThis is a lot less harsh as a facemask, and seems to do wonders for my skin. However, I really do not like the smell of this product, and it does linger even after thorough washing. (Chemical Mint smell!) \n\nGlamglow SUPERMUD cleanser\n\nSeems to work, but not my favourite so far. Same as with the mask, I find the smell a bit off putting. The foaming action is really good, though.\n\nP.s happy to ask any questions or to take any advice!",

My parents also worried that I did not have enough friends and that I am not living my life excitingly as a young man. I felt moderately annoyed at the time but ultimately it really doesn't matter too much. What your parents really want is for you to succeed, extroverts and introverts can both be very successful in their fields, they just have different approaches to it. So as long as you are doing fine and thriving in your life, they will feel happy for you, even if they might nag about certain things a bit.",

She deserves to dress like she pleases and be respected for being just a normal human being. She deserves a boyfriend who sticks up to her and defends and protects her from all this negativity. \nCan you imagine that playing the piano together with your girlfriend was the last happy moments your father had in his live? He did not kill himself because of being a perfectionist for your gf or how you all try to make it seem. And accusing someone of doing something bad by teaching how to play piano is just wrong.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo, all this did was piss me off. We all know racism still exists and it always will, not until the world can just somehow finally get the hell along with one another. \n\nFor starters, I am a white male. My wife and her whole family are also white. Well, last year for Christmas my daughter who was only 3 at the time was at the store with myself and my wife. We were Christmas shopping. \n\nMy daughter was looking at all the dolls. I asked her if she wanted one for Santa from Christmas, she said yes. But, she also said she wanted Santa to bring one for her female cousin who is the same age as her. \n\nWell, the wife and I decided to buy two of them. One for her and one for her cousin (we hid them from her sight of course). But, guess which dolls my daughter wanted? Yes, the black baby doll. \n\nI didn\'t see anything wrong with it. The color of our skin doesn\'t matter, nor should the color of the baby doll and this is the one our daughter wanted. We were happy, because we knew our niece would love the doll. \n\nNext stop, Christmas afternoon visiting my wife\'s brother and our niece and nephew. My in-laws were there as well and my brother in-laws baby momma. Our niece was opening the gift we got her, the baby doll. \n\nShe opened it up and was so happy. She absolutely loved the doll. But, the moment my brother in-law saw the doll, he had this horrid look on his face. Like his soul left his body. He eventually got up, all pissed off like. Went over to his daughter, took the doll away from her and went outside and threw it in the trash and was yelling and cursing, all on Christmas day. \n\nHe eventually came back in, our niece was crying and yelling at her daddy asking him where her doll went. He looked at us like we were the spawns of satan and asked *why the fuck did you buy that doll?*\n\nI got up, grabbed that fucker and brought him into the kitchen and I went off, asking why he threw the doll away, why he had a problem with it and why he doesn\'t see how he hurt his daughter. There was some cursing as well. I went off. \n\nAfter I got done yelling at him for pretty much ruining everyone\'s Christmas, I went outside, went to the trashcan and got the doll. Came back inside and gave it right back to his daughter, making sure he saw. \n\nI will forever remember the words I told him *If I find out that you threw this doll away again, I\'m going to come over here, beat your ass, get a black sharpie color your entire face black and spray paint half your white camaro black and write "This guy hates black people. He\'s a racist." on the rear windshield.*\n\nSo, AITA for this?\n\nTLDR: Bought niece a black baby doll for Christmas, brother in-law got pissed and threw it in the trash, I went and got it and gave back to my niece and told my brother in-law if he threw it away again I\'d beat his ass, found out my brother in-law was a racist on Christmas day.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

   'body': 'I had just failed out of college, lost my families respect and support, and a great deal of money. I was in shambles and couldn’t cope. I considered even self hurting or worse. My neighbor and friend came over to chill suddenly(he would knock on my door since middle school and would just ask if I was free). He came in at the time it was just me and I was having an episode of pure hate towards myself. He walked in and he said “let’s grab some beers and watch some stupid shit drunk!”. I laughed and agreed. We did just that and we joked and laughed for an entire evening drunk and watching dumb shows on Netflix. He left and dapped me up saying “be over soon yo love seeing your dumbass!”. He left and I couldn’t stop smiling. Something so simple yet so fun happened so suddenly. I stopped having bad thoughts and got myself together. I am currently attending community college and working to return to my previous college. My friend comes over still and I thank whatever high power is up there for a friend who can do so little and make me feel so happy. Thanks Carl your the best!',

   'body': "&gt;free kakak\n\n Agreed.\n\nMy mom, she is happy and she was most of the time, i guess my dad did his job well even if they had their own ups and downs . But the thing is, she got married at 15. It's like, she didn't really had her own life. \n\nMarried at 15, got one child at 17 and another at 19. All her life,she had been a housewife. She was born and raised in India, and came to Malaysian after marriage. I could only imagine sometime how lonely she should have felt at times, not knowing anyone here. Tho, I am really happy that things turned out better for her. Just that, I certainly agree getting married at a really young age is not good at all.",

   'body': '\nAs of today, 07/21/2020, r/bbw_chubby will no longer be allowing selling posts.  This was not an easy choice to make, but this sub was never meant to be a seller subreddit.  At least 50 percent of posts are now seller posts, and many new users are sellers.  We hope that women will continue to post here, for no other reason than it makes them happy - that is what this sub was always meant to be, a home for women to share pictures of their larger bodies, of all shapes and sizes.  We understand that there will be a bit of a transition period here, and hope everyone understands this decision.\n\nOn a more positive note, r/bbw_chubby will now be allowing art posts from users.  These art posts can be drawings/sketches, paintings, sculptures, digital art, etc.  This art can be made by the users, or can be simply art that they find beautiful - as long as it\'s credited properly in this case.  The main rules for this new type of submission are as follows...only high quality art (no doodles for instance), art must be of larger women (from chubby and up), credit must always be given, and photos run through one of the many "art" apps that exist will not be considered art.  Men or women can post art to the sub, as long as it follows these rules - I\'m hoping this will go well, have fun everyone!  Any questions or concerns, message me via modmail :) \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

   'body': "I grew up in a family that wasn't very open to....anything really. I am a 25 year old female. I have never really felt attracted to someone. Where as friends and family would make comments about wanting to sleep with someone based on their appearance alone. I have never  been able to have that type of...desire. \n\nI don't like the idea of being touched. I don't like seeing shirtless men. I don't like the idea of being touched. I grew up being told I have to like men and be with a man because I am a woman. And honestly at this point in my life I am depressed and hurt and I have no idea who I am verses who my parents made me be. \n\nSo if you guys would like to share your moments of realization for whatever sexuality/label you have i would appreciate that. Asexual, Bisexuality, Trans, Pansexual? Or anything else on the wide variety of possibilities. Thank you. I hope everyone that read or comments is in a good place and happy with who they have become.",

   'body': ' Ah - the problem here is that you were excited and probably quite happy (glowing) - thats the whole problem for an N. Being happy and excited is something that must be stamped out just as quick as it can. Happiness is not something an N likes around them.\n\n My Nrents were almost super-human in their ability to crap on almost all and everything that I might be happy about.\n\n There was one time that always stands out in my mind. I was in Grade 7 or so and got 100% on a test that I studied really hard for. I was ecstatic and ran home after school and so wanted to share my happiness with my Ndad.\n\n I honestly expected something good, a high-five, a "great job son!\' or something along that line. I ran up to my Ndad and showed him and he looked at the paper and his face changed to this look of disgust. I swear it was the same look as if I had handed him a used toilet paper.\n\n He looked at the paper and all he said was "You could have written it better" and tossed it back like he was throwing out a piece of garbage.  That was it. \n\n  He always got that look no matter what it was that I was happy about. There was something bad about me being happy. he made sure to crush it every time and as often as he could. he literally hated happiness around him.\n\n Listen mate, you should be ecstatic and I am happy for you! You got something for a hell of a deal, worked hard to find the right thing and you did good. I am a PC nerd from way back and understand your happiness.\n\n Share your joy with those who will be happy with you. Sad part of being and Ns kid is that its best not to share happiness with them, find someone who actually will care about your joy. Doing so will make your life better mate.',

   'body': 'Most humans are superficial and visual. We buy on impulse if something looks or feel good momentarily. \n\nWhat I see are two options:\n1) Drop your “friends”. You are not likely to get very far in life being surrounded with people like that. If they cannot feel happy for you that you found happiness and love, I’m guaranteeing you that none of them will be happy for you when you find success of any kind. Start socializing and connecting with people who can connect with you on a deeper level, beyond just the surface. But dropping off a friendship just like that is easier said than done, hence leading to my next point. \n\n2) It may be difficult given that you’ve spent time building up the friendship. It’s gonna hurt you. You can still remain friends, but don’t have to keep them close. Avoid the topic of your partner in front of them, if it comes to it, just be honest and say you would not like to talk about this with them. In a way, you’re slowing weaning off this friendship, while still expanding your own social circle. Should these “friends” react aggressively to you not wanting to discuss your boyfriend, you’d know what to do - that emotion will likely prime you to go back to option 1. \n\nMy wife is petite and absolutely beautiful, she loves me like no other while I’m big - I am of a tough build with that muffins on the side. So I get that, because I’ve heard comments about me from her “friends” before.  However, fast forward 15 years, we are now married for 3 years after 12 years of dating. What matters isn’t how your friends feel about your partner, but you have to be sure about him and that is gonna give him the confidence as well!',

   'body': 'They were making a joke, but I’m entirely with you on that feeling.\n\nMy mom is an alcoholic. She’s doing a lot better these days, and has apologized several times for the way I grew up, but I have similar scars to you. I think someone must have told me that my mom drank because she was sad, and so I tried to do everything I could to make her happy, so she would stop drinking and be the mom I needed.\n\nI somehow came to the conclusion that if I was perfectly well behaved, that would make her happy. Naturally, that’s not how it works. She was also extremely emotionally dependent on me, so I pushed away my own emotional needs to deal with hers (hers were always so overwhelming anyway that she never discussed or help me work through my own). \n\nCombine that with working in retail/food service from the time I was 16, and you get an anxious wreck of a person who can’t say no. \n\nI’m 31 now, and it’s taken most of my 20s to make progress, but I have. It requires a lot of self reflection, mourning for my childhood (which I am not done doing), researching, therapy, and lurking in communities like /r/CPTSD. \n\nWhat I’m saying is, if you’ve read this far lol, is you can feel better, and you can learn to make yourself your priority. I still suck at it, but I’m a lot better than I was at 20. It sounds overwhelming, but just take the work day by day. Eventually you’ll look back and go, god, I was miserable last month. Last year. And you’ll see how far you’ve come on the large scale just by making little steps day by day, even if a step is just pondering a sentence you came across that hit you right. \n\nBest of luck; I know you’re capable. ❤️',
