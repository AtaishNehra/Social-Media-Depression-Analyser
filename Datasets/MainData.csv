4,"Hey guys,
I was diagnosed with Atypical depression with panic features (F 32.8) and got the following drug treatment to go alongside my therapy :
Citalopram 20mg every morning
Alprazolam 0,25mg (half pill morning, half pill midday and one pill evening) 
Promethazine before sleep 

Wanted to ask if any of you got similar treatnent prescribed to them, and your experiences from these medicines. Reasons why i ask is i feel panic thinking about possibly gaining weight on these pills, thats my biggest worry, and also i never took any prescription drugs before, no illegal drugs either, so im scared shitless (pardon the language) of taking anything whatsoever and what effect its going to have on my mind. Any answer is much appreciated xx",1,hey guys diagnosed atypical depression panic features 328 got following drug treatment alongside therapy citalopram omg morning alprazolam 0 25mg half pill morning half pill midday pill evening promethazine sleep wanted ask got similar treatment prescribed eperiences medicines reasons ask feel panic thinking possibly gaining weight pills thats biggest worry took prescription drugs illegal drugs im scared shitless pardon language taking whatsoever effect going mind answer appreciated e

12,"Depression is like a cycle. Sometimes you're in best of the best, but then there are times you're in the rock bottom. You don't even know the definition of being okay, so you pretend to be cheerful or fake a smile in front of everyone.

I just realized that I'm currently at the rock bottom when I'm noticing that I've been randomly calling a lot of my friends recently. Most of the time, they won't accept the call because their busy with adulting. Even one of my friends got mad at me for calling randomly without telling first that I want to call her. I understand that we are all struggling well with adulting, but I'm too ashamed to admit that I can't cope up just like the normal adults should. No wonder people with loved ones who died due to depression (like committing suicide) regret in the end because they didn't pay attention. 

With regards to my family, I have a good relationship with them. But I'm having a difficulty to tell them how I truly feel. So I just pretend to be the cheerful person they know. 

Also, I've been prone to mistakes lately and I'm always scolded for always saying sorry but just do mistakes again. To be honest, I don't want to commit mistakes, but I'm too weak to act normally or even pretend to be okay. 

Although, it's alright. I just needed to let this off my chest. I know how to make myself feel better again. The only being I can only talk about this is God and my psychiatrist. I know that I just need to be patient and kind with myself, but it's really difficult to act on it when you're at the bottom. Like you couldn't control your mind as much as you want to set yourself free and be happy again.

The sad reality that I'm having difficulty to accept is that when you grow up  (and become an adult) and suffering depression, not everyone will have the time to listen or be with you because their busy with their own lives. So at the end of everything, you silently fight your battles alone.",1,depression like cycle youre best best times youre rock dont know definition okay pretend cheerful fake smile realized im currently rock im noticing ive randomly calling lot friends recently time wont accept busy adulting friends got mad calling randomly telling want understand struggling adulting im ashamed admit cant cope like normal adults wonder people loved ones died depression like committing suicide regret end didnt pay attention regards family good relationship im having difficulty tell truly feel pretend cheerful person know ive prone mistakes lately im scolded saying sorry mistakes honest dont want commit mistakes im weak act normally pretend okay alright needed let chest know feel better talk god psychiatrist know need patient kind difficult act youre like couldnt control mind want set free happy sad reality im having difficulty accept grow adult suffering depression time listen busy lives end silently fight battles

17,"my life has become a nightmareTnis will be a long read but I'm very grateful for those who will read it. I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been a happy person. I've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. I've done numerous drugs to try and help me. LSD, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, MDMA, but they always only help temporarily. I've been depressed. Always. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I can't remember the way I was before it ever came into my life. But life somehow started looking up for me, I had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. I had everything I've ever wanted in life. I wasn't happy but I was content and had a hope for my future.

Until two weeks ago where I made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when I was fucked up. I was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; I made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. I swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. I was on the highway going 60. My car got totalled. Ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.I was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. But I admitted in the emergency room that I was messed up &amp; under various drugs. I got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, DUI, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. I'm failing all my classes. I've always had a great GPA, a really good ACT score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. Besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. I put two other people in the hospital. 

One of them is a father. Has kids. &amp; He's been in the hospital since. He has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. I couldn't imagine what I would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. Ive been living with the guilt since. That I almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. I'm the lowest person and I honestly feel like I don't deserve to live. I wish I never wore my searbelt, that I was killed in the crash. I truly deserve it. Insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. I put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. We cant afford that. She works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. Besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. Ive lost everything. I've become a disgrace to my family, to society. My brother tells me daily how I should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit I am. My dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how I'm far worse than him. It hurts so fucking much. All of this does. I can't bear this emotional pain. I never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. Ive always been so nice and caring to others because I know life is hard &amp; I only wish to bring good to others. But I've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

I don't see a way out of this. I don't want one. I just wish I had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery I feel ALL the fucking time. I can't keep living. I don't deserve to. The only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. I love this girl to death. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. Shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. But I can't even see her with no car. I don't have a phone to talk to her. I'm probably going to lose her too. I hate that I'm making people suffer because of my decisons. These poor people I almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. I've truly lost everything. I hope so much that I just can end it all. To stop feeling this misery. To never have to see another day. Hopefully one day I will.

34,"She left again. Tonight's the night I'm done.
I'm killing myself tonight because I have literally no reason to be here anymore. I'm fed up with everything, the girl I've known for two years has been a blessing, she's been a crutch for me when I've needed it, she's helped me through everything and I've helped her. 
I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this. It's not your fault, you've been the reason I've made it to this age. I would've given up before if it weren't for you. I hope you can find happiness, I know I did.

I no longer feel pain,remorse,grief, anger, or anything. I've gone numb. I've given up. All that I really want now is to experience that pure calm of eternal nothingness.

no one really cares what I think or ever wants to talk to me

caught between wanting death and wanting kids

insomnia // shitty sleep quality 

I can function days without sleeping well. sometimes I don’t even want to sleep. 

haven’t been truly happy since elementary

masked emotions. I feel fake. like I just tap into latent emotions but nothing’s real. 

emotionally unstable. 

facade//mirage 

a black hole. 
-I wanna be with people but I don’t want to pull them down. 

I just want to sink

sometimes I wanna go to sleep and never wake up

I put on a smile and laugh but feel nothing. it’s not hard to fake a smile perfectly 

I watch others be happy whilst feeling like i’m alone. i’m fucking lonely. 

i’ve been isolated. had things I care about and grown attached to taken from me.
-for long periods of time 
-receiving gifts could never be my love language. the tangible can be taken. 

everything is temporary. everyone is temporary. 

but when i’m alone, i’m damaged. when i’m with people, i’m damaged. 

if you open up, you lose everyone. if you open up, you won’t be heard. 

I don’t cry on deaf ears. I add another drop to my ocean of torment. 

i am unwanted
-lest I am perfect 

thrown away

abandoned 

I need to be punished.

if I could take myself from everyone, not the other way around, they’d learn. 

emotions can never be felt right. not in moderation but extremes. 

when behind the wheel I think too often about suicide.
-speeding into a brick wall. slamming into oncoming traffic.

I wanna die fast and instantly. will only kill myself with if I KNEW I couldn’t come back. I don’t wanna have to explain myself or be disabled 

I can’t get help. I won’t help myself

73,"Sick Of The LonelinessI have been at an all time low these past few months.  I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since I was about 8 or 9.  I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.

I've tried for years and years to fight through, but it's not getting any better and is getting worse.  If it wasn't bad enough to have several co-morbid mental illnesses, even my therapist admitted that my life seems to have a never ending stream of bad situations/events.

I've always had trouble making friends, but thought I had a couple I could rely on.  But I get screwed over and pushed away when I tried to open up about my depression and struggles. I can't say I blame them - I wouldn't be around myself either if I had the choice.

I am straight, i have been in love with woman since High school, all of my best experience (sexually speaking) has always been with girls, and i (sorry for the word) have been masturbating to straight porn since how long i can remenber. I know i am straight due to my past..but recently..out of nowhere i have ""thought"" in my head that keep calling me i am gay, saying that what you liking is not what you like (basically girls..) , that you should go for men, and for some reason i can't have (sorry for the word..) a boner, despite watching either straight or Gay porn (i dislike gay porn, i don't like it and  t make me feel anything). It's hard to tell but i am having a sort of indentity crisis, i don't which genre i like even though i truly believe i am straigh, i though, maybe i am into guy's, but i don't enjoy the masculine body nor do i envy having relation with men, futhermore i try to look into my life (i am 19) and see if *maybe* i always rejected the idea that i was gay, but no, i have never felt love nor attraction against another men nor do i envy having sex with another guy, like mention above my best love experience where with women and before that i always wanted a life with a woman. 

The most bizarre thing is that **it came out of nowhere,** it wasn't like i have met someone ( a guy) and change my whole orientation..

84,"I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year now. I suffer from anxiety/depression which I am going to therapy for and he's always been super rational and does not suffer from any of this. Because he's never had such experiences, he asks a lot of questions to try to understand and in doing so sets off all of my insecurities about being a difficult person.

We have both had to work on our communication which has had its pros and cons. I am becoming more open to confrontation and he's trying to be more vocal about this affection. But I can't help but worry that we have too many fundamental differences. When we started out, I was handling my depression myself but lately it has gotten a bit worse.

For instance yesterday I couldn't stop crying all day and when he video called me I was just unable to lift my head. He tried to distract me but it wasn't going anywhere so he asked to hang up and I kept crying not exactly wanting him to leave. He still left after a bit saying it didn't seem like him being there was helping. We had an argument about this where I said that, you don't just leave someone mid-cry at the very least. 

We had a whole discussion about him being bad at consoling and he agreed that okay from next time if this happens he gets he needs to stay. But he ended up saying that, he tends to pick up traits of the people he is around and his fear is that if he's too invested in my depression, he will start becoming sad as well, so he's trying to work out a balance.

I understand worrying that taking care of someone else will take over your life, but I feel I'm not asking for that intensity of care either. I mostly handle it myself or vent sometimes and am going to therapy. It's just sometimes it gets out of hand and I expect to get some comfort from my significant other. I think because he has never had any of these experiences he's not able to understand how much work I am putting in to handle it myself, despite trying to explain.

My worry is that my idea of ultimate trust and comfort in a relationship down the line is that I will just be able to open up, vent, cry to my partner when I am having a hard time without worrying, meanwhile I think his fear is that I will do that too much and it will affect him. I feel what is comfort for me might be what is fear for him.

I feel I am trying hard to explain my situation to him and honestly I do feel like he is trying to understand as well but we keep clashing while trying to communicate and I feel it is making my anxiety so much worse. I love him and don't know what I should do.",1,dating boyfriend year suffer aniety depression going therapy hes super rational suffer hes eperiences asks lot questions try understand sets insecurities difficult person work communication pros cons open confrontation hes trying vocal affection cant help worry fundamental differences started handling depression lately gotten bit worse instance yesterday couldnt stop crying day video called unable lift head tried distract wasnt going asked hang kept crying eactly wanting leave left bit saying didnt like helping argument said dont leave mimicry discussion bad consoling agreed okay net time happens gets needs stay ended saying tends pick traits people fear hes invested depression start sad hes trying work balance understand worrying taking care life feel im asking intensity care handle vent going therapy gets hand epect comfort significant think eperiences hes able understand work putting handle despite trying eplain worry idea ultimate trust comfort relationship line able open vent cry partner having hard time worrying think fear affect feel comfort fear feel trying hard eplain situation honestly feel like trying understand clashing trying communicate feel making aniety worse love dont know

103,"I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.

104,"I feel like i'm just living because of other people, not because I have a will to live.The thought of killing myself gives me peace. All I want to do is end my life, but I can't do that because I love my parents and family, and killing myself is so selfish. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myslef is because I don't want to hurt the people that care about me. But I feel so unhappy and like my life is going nowhere, cause I'd love most of all to be dead. I feel numb, and every meaningless task just adds to the dull lie that I live with everyday. My life has no meaning, I don't want to live, but I can't end it cause I don't want to hurt my family. I feel like I'm in an empathetic paradox

174,"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me?

but i just cant. i don't have anything that i particularly love that i want to show it off. they're all just surface level shit like occasionally watching true crime or,,, idk i cant even think of anything.

201,"Man I just went to this one thread and finally was like, you know what, these people are too set on trying to make others hurt so deleted all my comments and hope no one follows me out ... this is not healthy and I even got a really bad vibe from one person. 

It's really crazy to me in a way that some people truly do for whatever reason get so into a dark place they are just trying to make others hurt, all they want is to make others feel pain as it's just become so dark in their reality ... and it's something I feel bad for as you have to be in such a dark place to be trying to intentionally hurt a complete stranger. I truly believe in what Yoda said:

**Fear is the path to the dark side**. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

This is so true, man Yoda is wise:

*A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.*

*In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.*

*To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not.*

That was really depressing and I feel really tired, like it's exhausting being around people who are that unhealthy they are trying to hurt others intentionally. I'll be OK. Just listen to music and watch my documentary about deers but ... yeah, that was difficult.

I certainly developed greater compassion for how tiring it must be to be around people like that a lot. Thankfully I don't know too many people stuck in that mode but so much compassion for what people have to absorb and live with, how much those experiences would change people towards the dark.

I really think any human can become very dark if you put them in a lot of darkness, humans really do absorb what you put them around I think.",1,man went thread finally like know people set trying hurt deleted comments hope follows healthy got bad vibe person crazy way people truly reason dark place trying hurt want feel pain dark reality feel bad dark place trying intentionally hurt complete stranger truly believe yoda said fear path dark fear leads anger anger leads hate hate leads suffering true man yoda wise challenge lifelong bend fear anger war danger losing answer power power jedi way depressing feel tired like ehausting people unhealthy trying hurt intentionally ill ok listen music watch documentary deers yeah difficult certainly developed greater compassion tiring people like lot thankfully dont know people stuck mode compassion people absorb live eperiences change people dark think human dark lot darkness humans absorb think

207,"I’m trying so hard to get betterTo start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no “I relate to that”, “I feel the same way” etc because I can’t handle the weight of other people’s struggles right now, because I can’t even handle my own. Thank you

I’ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. There’s never really been anything bad happening in my life. It’s always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. I’ve been in therapy since 7th grade (I’m now in 10th), but I definitely could’ve used it sooner. 

I’ve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. I’ve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says I’ve been making really good progress over the years, but I’ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I can’t deal with my gender identity, I’m constantly doubting wether I’m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. I’m disassociating really hard every day (I’ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I don’t even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can’t even comprehend who’s thoughts they are. I’ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. I’ve always felt like there’s something else wrong with me that hasn’t been diagnosed, but maybe that’s the hypochondria. Thus far I’ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I haven’t self harmed in awhile, but it’s just because I know it doesn’t really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that I’m a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that I’ve shed a few times, but now I’m stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. I’ve been on autopilot for so long. I’ve tried to get better for so long. I can’t remember a time that I wasn’t mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, it’s like that’s just how god designed me. 

I’m tired of people telling me “it’ll get better”, “it won’t be like this forever”, “you can keep going”. This is all I’ve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I can’t see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I can’t escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I can’t even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so I’m probably not gonna kill myself anyway. It’s too much to plan and I know I’ll probably forget something important. It’s permanent and drastic, and I don’t do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

I’m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or I’ll suddenly realize something, or I’ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if they’re personal. I’m desperate.",1,im trying hard betterto start receive constructive comments relate feel way etc cant handle weight peoples struggles right cant handle thank ive deal mental health struggles long remember mom told aniety attack age 3 theres bad happening life makes harder unlike certain event situation thoughts ive therapy ith grade 10th definitely couldve sooner ive ups downs past 2 years recently came transgender female male life complicated lost friends childhood group friends stopped going traditional public school years ive self harmed clean relapsed thought better months left outpatient start summer says ive making good progress years ive close suicide daily basis cant deal gender identity im constantly doubting wether im trans simultaneously eperiencing crippling gender dysphoria im disassociating hard day eperienced disassociation middle school long intense dont recognize face body voice things way act feel like shell person remember taking step analyze thinking cant comprehend whos thoughts ive stopped talking people fact longer eperience live hurts makes feel hopeless ive felt like theres wrong hasnt diagnosed maybe thats hypochondriac far ive diagnosed aniety ocd depression havent self harmed awhile know doesnt help hurts way describe im cicadas shell outside ive shed times im stuck shell longer eist outside world shell state felt connected dont feel like person anymore idea deepest level ive autopilot long ive tried better long cant remember time wasnt mentally struggling feels like life different like thats god designed im tired people telling itll better wont like forever going ive known mental turmoil short periods feeling ok cant possible way matter got run problem head cant escape distract short time cant remember eat forget basic things decisions im probably gonna kill plan know ill probably forget important permanent drastic dont making permanent drastic decisions im hoping finally clicks days ill suddenly realize ill find lets light end tunnel feel free ask questions theyre personal im desperate

I can't have a relationship to save my life because my examples of love and compassion were so fucked up. I try and try to fix what damage has been done to me. I've tried everything I can imagine, meds, therapy, meditation, drugs, ignoring it, pretending everything will work out, and I still feel lost and isolated. I don't want to die I just want to be OK and feel something other than pain and hate. I love someone and I can't tell them because if they know what I deal with it will just bring them down.

I've been looking for a better job for well over a year now and I can't even get anyone to look at my resume. Ive been applying to several jobs a day, I actually have my default tabs set to job boards that I search and apply on in my spare time. Since I started I have has 4 interviews but they offered me less that I am making now even with my hours and responsibilities being cut.

I want to work so bad it is literally killing me inside that no-one will even look at my resume, or won't offer me a living wage.

I just found our that my rent is going up. One of my bills has also doubled because of a late fee since I couldn't afford to pay it on time. I am just so done. I hate myself and I hate my life but kost of all I hate living. For the first time since I moved out on my own I wasn't able to pay rent this month and my roommate had to make up the difference. It's looking like that will happen again next month and on top of that I have no idea how I can afford to pay my bills now. My savings is gone, cost of living is rising, and I am just a burden on those around me.

I'm tired of being a burden on others and I'm tired of working a dead end job that I despise knowing that no matter how hard I try I will never get out of it. I'm going to end it.

246,"Hi, my wife has chronic depression. It's insidious because she functions with it, but it robs her of agency, career direction, friends, and everyday joy. She says she ""feels dead"". She's been like this for 20 years, and it's gotten worse lately, with the pressures of parenting and covid. She has been in psychotherapy for that time, going from one therapist to another, not healing much. The main reason for this is that she feels dull, and is unable to get in touch with her pain, to say ""this hurts! help me!"" So, she tells me that these therapy sessions are pretty superficial, e.g. the discussion is around 'I don't like this person at work', my wife leaves feeling a little better, but never gets to the real issue. She just decided to stop seeing her therapist. This therapist told her 'you don't like yourself'. When my wife asked the therapist how she could fix that, she apparently had no answer. I am in therapy and I get a lot out of it, but unfortunately my wife does not. It pains me to see her so stuck, so inert. I have told her that the first step to getting help is to write down what she specifically wants to get out of the therapy. Nonetheless, she says that she doesn't feel much pain around not liking herself, so I'm worried that if she finds a new therapist that the same superficial thing will happen. She has thought about microdosing as a way to get out of the depression. I suggested CBT, and maybe some spiritual practice. I know that ultimately she has to take the initiative. The problem is that she hasn't. What, if anything, can I do to help my wife get better, to snap out of the dull trance of depression?

Another weird thing that happened recently: I keep seeing ""these"" things disturbing me day after day. It's not creatures but more like visualization of other people dying. I will be telling my therapist this tomorrow. 

Mental stuff aside, my academic life is as abysmal as you can imagine, I been trying to apply to school this fall and still not succeed. Soo much crap just to apply to my local community collage! I even went here in 2017 and still wanted my freaking high school transcript!! I dropped out due to low self esteem issues and depression like usually.

Past life? I am idiot how can't do the most basic of task without requiring help/dependent on others, I blame my family and myself for my sheltered upbringing (I am 27). Now being a sheltered child had many many horrible traits for me, I easily got taken advantage and screwed over by many people, and even got homeless due to it. And yes...I still live with my parents.

Army life was even harsher since I didn't even know to shave. I was the primary target for everyone. I only lasted 2 years before leaving early, and crap my asvab is 36 lol took me four tries for that score! WHY doe everything have to be shit all the time? Everything I was excited for when I was young got destroyed, even my teachers give me no hope, always telling me down that I will never amount to anything. They were right, I have only caused more misery.  

What do I do? I lost 59 pounds and can fit into thin clothes because everyone says getting fit and building muscle will help. I STILL FEEL NOTHING. I am in a endless blackhole.

There is no way to make myself to become ignorant again so there is no joy anymore. Never was here it was just an illusion.

267,"I'm 18 and I've had depression for six years. I've had brief periods of non-depressive states such as my first semester of my Junior year. What got me away from the depression was meeting a girl who became my best friend. We hung out everyday and it gave me a lot of confidence in myself leading to me making more friends and making out with a few girls for the first time. She went on to get a boyfriend and we stopped talking. I've been to a psych ward, residential treatment center and a wilderness program since then. 
    Everyday life seems a bit more and more pointless. I always feel like if this one thing would just happen, everything would be fine. But it never is. I've smoked weed every night since Nov. 2019 to help with the pain. The next morning I always sleep 11+ hours and wake up still extremely tired. 
    My natural state is tired and heavy. I go to parties or sessions with friends every night but it gets repetitive. 
    Last night at a party I finally did something I've been stressed about for years, thinking it would never happen all through college. I lost my virginity. It was awesome and I was hyped all night. But now it's the next day and everything is still the same. Why work towards anything? Why try? I just get what I want, am happy for an hour, and then it's my new normal. Nothing excites me.

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can.

Then after all that emotional turmoil and endless working you eventually get old, get a bunch of diseases that you Wikipedia and understand exactly the way they're killing you, but it doesn't change anything and understanding it doesn't make it any easier.   Then you die, and maybe you're lucky and a couple people are there by your side when you cease to exist.   Maybe, but probably not - they have jobs and relationships to manage too and their bosses aren't very understanding when it comes to this stuff.  Being a decent human being cuts into their bottom line.

I'm sick of it.   I'm sick of having only this pointless life to look forward to.   I'm sick of being alone.   People only give a fuck when they have something to gain - even here on this subreddit, you bastards are doing this because you get a fucking masturbatory ego boost from thinking you ""helped"" someone.   You wanna help someone?   Go outside and talk to someone who looks lonely.  Stop fucking around on here.   Talk to someone who looks lonely, don't even bother trying to make it profound and interesting, just talk and let it the conversation go where ever it has to.   So what if it gets depressing, actually risk having a down night instead of coming here where you can alt+f4 the minute you start getting uncomfortable.  Actually give something.   Shit.

We're all so fucking busy with our Facebook and our iPhones and our goddamn blogs that we've stopped talking to eachother face to face.

That's what we have to look forward to, a future filled with people absorbed in their own bullshit.   

I don't want to live in that world.

Fuck everyone who's ever seen someone who needed help and didn't reach out.

Fuck everyone who ever stepped on someone else for personal gain.

Fuck everyone who's ever hated someone just because they were different.

Fuck my parents for bringing me into this shithole.

I’ve tried to fix myself I’ve literally begged my parents to let me lift weights and gain confidence but they believe that it will damage my “bones” and “growth”.

344,"Say, if you were writing book and I'm your best friend who you know likes to write. You ask me for ideas on a certain part. I'm all about you, boo. I give you every idea, every angle, I'm obsessed with your work (in the way that's outpouring support), I check in with you on it every so often, and I tell you how I KNOW it's gonna get published, to not feel uncertain in your talent and that when it does, I will buy ten copies.

Then, when the book gets published and you're rolling in success and happiness, I actually do buy ten copies, no, I buy fifteen. I'm so goddamn happy for you, it's my favourite book. I tell all my friends and family about it, how it is the best goddamn thing and that they need to go buy a copy.

But deep on the inside, through caves upon caves, I also hate you. I hate you so much. Because your success and happiness just reminds me of how little and meaningless I am and that I'll never be as successful as you. I'll never have this moment, and if I tried, something would happen where it would be taken away.

But you'll never know. You'll never have a clue.

You may think this isn't so bad but...it is.

I can't stand celebrities and I love when they're not good people because that gives me all the more reason to hate them. I hate their money, their talent, their looks, and their perfect little lives. From Bella Poarch to Beyoncé, if i see anything related to them on social media, they get an instant dislike from me.

I love KPOP/JPOP music but i often can't listen to it because I get too jealous. WHY couldn't I have been born this genetically flawless amazing star? Why couldn't it have been me? Why can't I be this talented and beautiful?

Don't even get me started on romance. I hate couples. 

For amazing people like Chadwick Boseman, if soul trading was a thing, I'd give mine to him. I am useless and have no worth and he was someone who was gone too soon, suffered when he shouldn't have. If I could have traded places with him, I would have.

Why do I have to be this homely looking mixed girl whose parents don't even think is worthy enough to have any effort put into her? What did I do to deserve THIS? Everything about my birth was an ACCIDENT: I wasn't planned, I wasn't wanted, I'm a twin but my twin died, i was born at home because they didn't get the hospital on time, my name was misspelled- need I go on?

I will say, just to be a bit clearer here, is that I never ever wish bad things on anyone or do anything underhanded (the most negative I could be towards someone I'm super jealous of is to keep them at a  distance because it just...hurts. Their happiness and positivity just fucking hurts). I wouldn't dream of doing that and if something bad happens to a celebrity that I ""admire"" (as much as I'm capable of anyway), then I'm outpouring support to them and upset too.

IT'S. NOT. FAIR. IT'S. NOT. FAIR.

But, fuck...why did I have to be me? Why can't I be someone else? Different race, different place, different time, and with different people around me? Why do I have to be stuck with me?

355,"20 [M] So for the last year I have been running my own business in the marketing space and have seen little to no results. Since I am young I peruse this full time. 

For the majority of the time running this business, I have been kept going by bursts of motivation, Hope and optimism, but over the last month I’ve had this vail of hope and optimism removed and the reality has set in which has been crushing me and filling my mind with self doubt and imposter syndrome. I feel like a failure and all I want is to succeed and treat my friends and family. 

The worst part Is that to other people it seems as if I am doing well and I’m too embarrassed to say the truth that the business has gotten nowhere so I spin small lies. I know in the bigger picture I will succeed, but dealing with the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with this business has been very hard. 

This is just a vent I needed to type out and put out there.

I hate the fact that I don’t look normal I’m smaller than the average guy and always envied tall and average height guys because they have the luxury of being normal. All I’m ever seen as is just some loser who overcompensates for his height. I never even liked my life that much either college sucks and was a complete lie people told me when they said college gets better. “It gets better” what a bunch of bullshit. I’m thinking of taking out someone else but murder will just land me in jail not death well at least not immediately but I do plan on doing something stupid since it won’t matter so hopefully I’ll do something fun/illegal but in the end just leads to my death anyway.,1,reason live arent normalthis post dont plan reddit tomorrow im actually going going plan kill stuff planned talking letters written going send tet loved ones family hour finish day playing pokemon wake drive look cliff jump hate fact dont look normal im smaller average guy envied tall average height guys luury normal im seen loser overcompensates height liked life college sucks complete lie people told said college gets better gets better bunch bullshit im thinking taking murder land jail death immediately plan stupid wont matter hopefully ill fun illegal end leads death

412,"I used to be the happiest person in my clique and was rarely affected emotionally. 
I'm also the one that always believed that everything is gonna be alright whenever i had bad days. 

I was full of positive energy until I entered polytechnic (something like college in my country). I was seperated from my close friends for 7 years as we are seperated into different path. I met a girl in my school and fall in love deeply. I wasn't the type that fall in love easily but when I do, i really do. We were close for years doing everything together like studying, going home and many activities. Sadly, i was just treated as a close friend. I was okay but i was not able to let go of her but instead i kept trying. 

My life have been tough due to my intership and many problems i am facing which make me constantly upset. But i'm thakful to have her by myside supporting me through difficult phase of life. 

One day i found out that she was using  a dating app trying to find a boyfriend. I was deeply affected because this was all along behind my back. Although i'm not his boyfriend to say anything but i really care for her and I just can't bare to let her go because i really do love her. Because of this i became very depressed. Some people thinks that it's stupid to be depressed over a girl but i just can't help myself no matter what i do. I just can't help but to think about killing myself every single day. 

It's hard for me to let go as she's one of the only few friends i've made in school. I have give in so much and spend mostly my whole  life in new school wif her.

I was the one who got yelled at the most, as my grades are falling, but I do not think that he understands that things get harder and harder, and since I got such good grades when I was 7-9 years old, he had such high expectations for me. This is not the main problem though, the main problem is that he gets angry at such unimportant things such as forgetting when the movie starts, even though we still managed to get there in time. He gets really angry and ignores me, and yells at me every time he has a chance. I feel so pressured around him, my mom tried to talk to him, but he never listens and yells at her. My mom is already stressed from her work and every time she talks to my dad, she ends up crying.

The longest time he has ever ignored me was a month. And even though he ignores me, he yells at meevery chance he has. Even though sometimes the argument stops, I still try to ignore him cause I fear him. I try to avoid conversations with him overall. Then another argument starts. This cycle repeats all over again.

In recent years, I started to feel like I have no purpose in life. Even though I feel happy sometimes, I still think this work is dark and I am starting to hate my life. I feel like my friends are way luckier than me.  My mom does not take this seriously and tells me I will feel better someday, but the situation has gotten worse and I have not felt happiness for a long time. I wish I was never born.

It wasn't just the perceived end of the relationship that I attempted suicide over though, that was just the last straw.

437,"My life is in danger and nobody fucking knows.I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it through today. I'm at work and feel like I'm about to crash and lose my shit and have a total breakdown in front of everyone. I feel the urge to scream and hide and cry and stab myself all at the same time. I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say ""sorry I have a migraine :("" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. ""I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine."" Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not fucking fair.

I’m tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep, even though I’m not tired. I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while. I wanna just stop existing for a little while. I’m so burnt out. Not even from school. I’m burnt out from life. The nice thing about it all, though, is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore. I’m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college, and all I can help but think about is how much I don’t care about my future anymore. I don’t care about the consequences of my life anymore. It’s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it won’t matter in the long run since there won’t be a long run. A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore, so my fuck-ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain.",1,times thinking suicide recentlybeen antidepressants half year things gotten worse taking recently started thinking repercussions suicide happen die whats quickest efficient way thats painful dont wanna act like ive got huge sob story life doomed start im sick hating wanting somebody im tired waking wanting sleep im tired wanna sit metal bo stare wall long wanna stop eisting little im burnt school im burnt life nice thing thought kinda like power caring anymore im graduate high school dream college help think dont care future anymore dont care consequences life anymore nice care little things hate screw things instead feeling like crap think wont matter long run wont long run hopes things worse care anymore fuckups stop having power mentally ill brain

No, I won't tell you the name, and I do not recommend going there, but I will describe how depressing and sad a place it was.

Most of the people on the board actually want to commit suicide, they fantasize about it. They think it is a great thing, and they are happy to go to their death. Why they haven't killed themselves if they beleive that, I don't know. 

They share methods, and troubleshoot the methods, and provide tips and tricks to kill youself. Several times, people actually seemed to kill themselves while on the site, live blogging their own death, and talking about how they were feeling until they were gone. It was heartbreaking, but the people seemed to be happy to go. Whether it was a hoax or they actually died, I do not know, but everybody wished them ""success.""

They represent it as a platform for free speech, but it seems obvious to me they are promoting and enabling suicide. I had quite a few discussions with the people there, trying to understand their position, but I realized that I am not like them because I actually want to live. Terrible place. I had to quit going there for own mental health.",1,lately spent time suicide forum didnt know eisted place people actually advocating supporting suicide wont tell recommend going describe depressing sad place people board actually want commit suicide fantasize think great thing happy death havent killed beleive dont know share methods troubleshoot methods provide tips tricks kill youself times people actually kill site live blogging death talking feeling gone heartbreaking people happy got hoa actually died know everybody wished success represent platform free speech obvious promoting enabling suicide discussions people trying understand position realized like actually want live terrible place quit going mental health

I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.

534,"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do.""

I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. I can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. But no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.

599,"I'm on about week 7 of sertraline now and I can honestly say it has worked wonders. I'm 22 and 23 in a few days, i have been depressed starting from like the age of 13, 14, struggled with anxiety too and a bunch of other things that turned out to be adhd which i was diagnosed with in January. I tried the 3 main types of adhd medication including both types of stimulant, to no avail. When i was on the stimulants i was out of work, not in a routine and depressed, my mood was so up and down but mostly down. I stopped taking them as they were having no effect and decided to try anti-depressants for a while. And oh boy have they helped. So at first i felt no different and maybe a bit more suicidal in the first 2 weeks or so but by tye 4th week i could tell the difference, and now in week 7 I feel good for once. I never have the super low lows i used to, i do have low mood sometimes but not as often. Week 3 to 6 i felt pretty numb, not bad, but also not good. But this week has been good so far i have a lot more energy to do things i feel like. I have started going to the gym again 3 weeks ago and am enjoying it again like i used to. If i forget to take my medication for a day,by the end of the day I can tell. So I'm not totally fixed yet, but I finally have some progress.

I have far less negative thoughts. I used to have intrusive thoughts that were almost obsessive as well. It was always a downward spiral, like thinking about my girlfriends rape or other things that really upset me. I'm I finally have sorted out my room after years, and actually enjoyed doing it. As i have adhd i still get hyperfixated on stuff and obsessive thoughts, but recently it has been about decorating my room and finding new furniture i like for it.

Idk it was tough, I'd feel bad even when nothing was wrong, i coudl think about nothing but just feel bad like there was some negative energy possessing my brain. But i don't have that anymore.

Also having sex and things with my girlfriend has been a lot better in some ways. I feel a lot more sensitive down there and get stronger sensations which is great. The downside is I am finding it hard to climax and have only managed to by myself a couple of times in the last 4 weeks.

The adhd issues still bother me and upset me sometimes, but i think it would be good to try the stimulants again in the future when my mood is more stable, and I'm in a position where it is only the adhd symptoms affecting me",1,im week 7 sertraline honestly worked wonders im 22 23 days depressed starting like age 13 14 struggled aniety bunch things turned adhd diagnosed january tried 3 main types adhd medication including types stimulant avail stimulants work routine depressed mood stopped taking having effect decided try antidepressants oh boy helped felt different maybe bit suicidal 2 weeks tye ith week tell difference week 7 feel good super low lows low mood week 3 6 felt pretty numb bad good week good far lot energy things feel like started going gym 3 weeks ago enjoying like forget medication darby end day tell im totally fied finally progress far negative thoughts intrusive thoughts obsessive downward spiral like thinking girlfriends rape things upset im finally sorted room years actually enjoyed adhd hyperfiated stuff obsessive thoughts recently decorating room finding new furniture like ink tough id feel bad wrong think feel bad like negative energy possessing brain dont anymore having se things girlfriend lot better ways feel lot sensitive stronger sensations great downside finding hard clima managed couple times 4 weeks adhd issues bother upset think good try stimulants future mood stable im position adhd symptoms affecting

632,"Suicide is not an option for me. That's not just a tired saying, it's my reality. But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. 

I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.

I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.

Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.

I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.

I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.

I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.

It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.

I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.",1,suicide option thats tired saying reality thing think herei crossposted r depression im sorry twice ive lurking main long time dont know fit im sorry situation isnt relatable sounds stupid great life know people im matter trying try push friends family away cant pretty traumatic childhood people life decade remaining family amazing suicide absolutely option people care know know sounds dad grandma pass away table friends relatives sad dad young parent young healthy ive got couple decades reality resent thats darkest thought ive ive told worst moments upset dad favorite person world alive healthy going stay way means stay alive decades dont want im gainfully employed job love love im wealthy support job incredibly stressful coworkers good people boss good person believe work pays bills epensive city friends ability friends instead going socializing pushing people away dont know feel like working normal person faking best possible isolate lot friends weird confusing dont know got lucky friends matter avoid theyre cool people theyre intelligent successful going lives dont know ive tricked people friends ive tricked job keeping employed ive tricked family supportive need undo hurting dont want alive anymore time minor thing goes wrong thought hits like ton bricks time im im lot dont know feel fucking trapped amazing supportive friends family absolutely crushed told theyd probably committed theyd probably try quit stressful job complaints life framed job stressful yeah mentally healthy person handle hell slightlymorehealthy version years ago handle id got friends family tired id situation people like ive got backwards reason depressed right cripplingly tell life turned upside ill genuine reason want die time 12 dont know im sorry rambling hard follow im sorry sounds self involved bragging dont understand ive gotten unfairly lucky life wish good things going genuinely love miss know sounds awful

647,"Dear reddit, after taking a look at my life I realized that I have no-one to talk to.and that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that, there are none who are willing to offer it.

I have nobody, not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood.

Speaking of moods, I'm in a fairly dangerous one. Not for others, mind you, I don't believe in harming other people for no good reason. My mood is hazardous to my own health.

Most days I'm suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain. Today I find myself quite lacking in caution, self-preservation instinct, and the ability to care whether or not I live or die.

On top of all this I have work in about 1 1/2 hours and I'm not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly.


EDIT: Oh right, lest we forget, the biggest reason I can't talk to anyone is because they're all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems, especially if I decide to stick around.

650,"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

681,"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

739,"I don't have many friends or keep in contact with many, people, previously I felt a lot of pain through this, but then just decided to not give a fuck and live my own life and if people dont contact me I let it go.

To the point where I wasn't in contact with many people, I contracted COVID and was very sick, I had my mother to take care of me, oh yeah also at 33 I had to move back becuase u lost my job.

I realised I had barely anyone to tell I was sick, barley anyone asking if I was ok, all these years and I haven't managed to build a network that cared about me. No one checking up on me but my mom and brother, there was a night I felt like I am dying, I couldn't breathe. And it wouldnt matter much, 

My ex wife who I have beautiful children with, we keep breaking up and getting back together in a toxic cycle where she tells me what a piece of shit I am but then when I leave she blames me for ""breaking up the family"" she also keeps me from making friends with jealousy.

I realised I could just die, everyday my body is decaying, I've applied for so many jobs, and I have gotten 8 interviews and haven't landed a single one. Before Zoom interviews I've landed every single one of my jobs, but post that in Zoom I can't land any, after the interview I just don't hear back.

Also, my parents are, are getting rid of this house and moving abroad in a few months and Literally don't have a single cent and with my Ex wife asking me to get back and move back with the family is my only option, but I know she will start treating my like shit in a few days, her making all the money and paying for everything while I have nothing. 

And to be honest I don't even blame her for it becuase I don't offer anything as a man.

The only reason I don't kill myself is becuase, I don't want to put my kids through that, my 14 year old doesn't talk to anyone he's always either gaming or ignoring everyone, he goes to sleep at 2am and even though I've spoken to my ex about she told me she makes the money so she will parent. I get no respect from the kids. Although my 8 year old has a very good relationship with me and looks up to me.

I don't think I've been such a bad guy in life I have ADHD I struggle with work and remembering things, but I'm not an asshole and always try my best but it's never good enough.

I am also suffering from what I believe to be long haul covid symptoms, I am very tired, even more than normal, I am trying to wake up early but mid day I fall asleep and then sleep most of the night, my lungs and breathing is so bad that I can't even run or work out like I used to to improve mood.

I am mentally and physically exhausted, I am broke, I am lonely, I am rejected by job after job, and my ex/partner treats me like shit, but also is the only one sending me money and doing things to help me so that even makes me feel worse.

In top of that I just know traumatic experiences are waiting for me, my grandmother parents, and aunts who I am fairly close with will die, and these are just trauma incidents waiting for me. Even if I dig myself out of this episode, I most likely there will just be more episodes in the future becuase I always fuck up anyway.

Even if I get a job and leave my ex, I will have to deal with not seeing my kids, she is very smart, savvy and manipulative, I can't win against her, I will see my kids with a stepdad and it will be a reminder of what I failure I am and how I couldn't keep my family together becuase I'm a loser.

My brother age 18 is also off to study in the U.S my stepdad an American Citizen who married my mom when I was 15 could have submitted some forms which would have given me access to the US but it has to be done before you are 18 and he didn't do it for me even though I begged them to do it, I had a chance to live in the U.S to get opportunities as apposed to South Africa with the high crime and lack of jobs but he couldn't do a simple form.

He calls my brother everyday and tell him he loves which he didn't do for me, he took my brother to tour England and the U.S and I have never left the country. He is making sure his son gets every opportunity but always got mad whenever my mom did something for me and my education and none of this ever gets talked about I have to smile like nothing happened.

My dad also didn't pay attention to me and went on having his own family even though I enjoyed being around him, his personality and so on.

When I have arguments with my ex wife she also reminds me that my father or stepfather doesn't love me or want my becuase of ""the type of person I am"" 
I just feel like I can't I have no options, I don't have anymore strength",1,dont friends contact people previously felt lot pain decided fuck live life people dont contact let got point wasnt contact people contracted couid sick mother care oh yeah 33 becuase u lost job realised barely tell sick barley asking ok years havent managed build network cared checking mom brother night felt like dying couldnt breathe wouldnt matter e wife beautiful children breaking getting toic cycle tells piece shit leave blames breaking family keeps making friends jealousy realised die everyday body decaying ive applied jobs gotten 8 interviews havent landed single zoom interviews ive landed single jobs post zoom cant land interview dont hear parents getting rid house moving abroad months literally dont single cent e wife asking family option know start treating like shit days making money paying honest dont blame becuase dont offer man reason dont kill becuase dont want kids 14 year old doesnt talk hes gaming ignoring goes sleep ive spoken e told makes money parents respect kids 8 year old good relationship looks dont think ive bad guy life adhd struggle work remembering things im asshole try best good suffering believe long haul couid symptoms tired normal trying wake early mid day fall asleep sleep night lungs breathing bad cant run work like improve mood mentally physically ehausted broke lonely rejected job job e partner treats like shit sending money things help makes feel worse know traumatic eperiences waiting grandmother parents aunts fairly close die trauma incidents waiting dig episode likely episodes future becuase fuck job leave e deal seeing kids smart savvy manipulative cant win kids stepdad reminder failure couldnt family becuase im loser brother age 18 study stepdad american citizen married mom 15 submitted forms given access 18 didnt begged chance live opportunities apposed south africa high crime lack jobs couldnt simple form calls brother everyday tell loves didnt took brother tour england left country making sure son gets opportunity got mad mom education gets talked smile like happened dad didnt pay attention went having family enjoyed personality arguments e wife reminds father stepfather doesnt love want becuase type person feel like cant options dont anymore strength

744,"I’ve been trying to find a therapist since February. I have a psychologist that prescribes my anti depressants that I’ve have since February. I stopped taking them about a month ago mostly because I kept forgetting to take them but then it lead to just giving up. I mean I’m on 5 of them and I still want to end everything.

Anyway, I thought I had found a therapist 2 months ago. She seemed like she actually wanted to have me as a patient unlike the other ones I found. I missed our second appointment at 6pm by pure accident since I was out running errands the entire day and didn’t even get home until 7. She kept the same day and time without telling me over the phone but through my work email that I don’t even check on a daily basis. I’ve never had a therapist that didn’t communicate over the phone. So then when I figured out that would be the day and time we would use, I waited for her to come online only to find out she moved it to a day earlier and at a different time, again through email.

Is it my fault completely or was she just not a good choice since there was no communication? I even told her at the first meeting that I don’t check my work email everyday and that it would be her to just simply call me.",1,ive trying find therapist february psychologist prescribes anti depressants ive february stopped taking month ago kept forgetting lead giving mean im 5 want end thought found therapist 2 months ago like actually wanted patient unlike ones found missed second appointment pure accident running errands entire day didnt home 7 kept day time telling phone work email dont check daily basis ive therapist didnt communicate phone figured day time waited come online find moved day earlier different time email fault completely good choice communication told meeting dont check work email everyday simply

779,"I'm living in a below standard family in Canada, my parents divorced and my and my 2 sisters live with my mom because my mother gave everything to my dad (all the money, she only kept the house so we can have a place to live) just to stay with us, she knows we won't be happy with my dad. The story begins before the divorce, our house is in the end of a road because when we moved to Canada my 2 sisters were still young so my mom thought it would be safe to buy a house like that so when we play we have less chance to get hit by a car and right next to us is a small forest. Because of that there are very good amount of wild animals near us, and one of the animals that are annoying us is the rats that won't stop comming into the house. So we decided to have cats so the rats will get scared away me personally I really really like pets, we bought 3 cats one after another, and it actually worked.  But Good times don't last long, two of the cats left the house and never came back, because we like to let our cats go outside and discover around the house, and also completely get rid of rats. We don't know untill today why they left us, maybe because they got into danger (there's coyotes in our area). I got really sad and cried, that only cat that stayed was our main character of this story her name's attagirl (translated, real name is XiaoGuai)she's just like other two cats, also likes to go outside. she was with me and looking through my eyes, maybe wondering why I was crying or confused by why other two cats disappeared. But that was very touching. Anyways, not long after my parents separated (if you guys want to hear that story I can do it too, it's also a very crazy story) and 2 years after when she turns 4 years old, I'm not even sure about her exact age because I am a terrible owner but we know the year we got her (2017) and she was only few months old. So when she's about 4 years old my mom started to notice something unusual, attagirl starts to be deppressed and desperately wants to go outside, before when we want to keep her inside she just trys a few times and give up, but starting from few months ago, if we don't let her go outside she just become sad and keep looking outside, and there is were the true nightmare begins. She lost tons of weight just in 2 or 3 weeks and she kept scratching her face untill it bleeds and doesn't even stop. So we took her to an emergency clinic, and paid 800 bucks for a blood test and an injection of a weak antivirus. The doctor said she doesn't know what's going on with her and need to keep doing tests, but the cost will be at 2.1k so my mom decided to not do that because we can't afford it. We took her home and 3 days late she lost her vision, we set her up at a bedroom and fed her food everyday even tho she barely eats any. and last night I was in my bed watch my phone and I heard a little meow sound, from my door. And I got confused because her room is pretty far from mine, and she barely meows even when she's healthy, so I went to her room and a few moments later she suddenly stand up and walked around, she couldn't control her balance because of the blindness, and finally she fell on the ground and can only breathe. I stayed besides her it was 2am and I stayed untill 5am then I couldn't open my eyes anymore so I went to sleep. This morning, we know she's at her limit, even when she started to be blind we asked another doctor her said attagirl will not live longer and I cried my fucking assoff, I tried to bring her back to the clinic but my mom said no, because it's too expensive and may not even find a solution, this is fate we can't stop it. She also said pets like these will always go ahead of us, it's just a Mather of time. So now I'm just letting her dying slowly and listening to her lound meows that I've never heard before from her and just can't do anything. I'm so useless, I'm only 17 and only has 1 job, can't do anything, can't make enough money, can only cry and watch her suffers to death. This happened because we lack of experience, if we brought her to vet earlier maybe this will never happen and she will live longer than now. I'm so so so depressed. And because of covid we didn't do the injection she should be doing every year that perhaps was also a reason. 

Ps: ik some of yall may not even read because it's too long sorry about that but this is what truely happened to me, and I want to share with you guys cuz she is actually a very great cat, every time I come back from school she just sits in the front door like a gard for our house, she likes to sleep on my chest. And always teleports when she heard treats or cane food.

790,"My life is falling apartHi all, 

This is my first and maybe last post on here. I’ve had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each other’s backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.

A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mother’s Day and just didn’t see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact I’m going to prison for 2+ years. She’s also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out they’ve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently I’m just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. 

I’ve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like I’ve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasn’t popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. 

So basically I’ve decided to end it. My entire life I’ve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. I’ve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon I’m going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. 

Now it’s just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. I’m not sure when I’ll go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when I’m in prison.

794,"I'm beyond hope ugly, so why *shouldn't* I end it?I'm revolting enough that every woman I've ever asked out has gotten angry that someone so ugly would bother. Not beautiful women, but women I thought were plain-looking or somewhat ugly too. One girl went out with me out of sheer pity, but she couldn't bear the ugliness after a few days and broke it off.

Even my mom reminds me of it every time I call. I'm 33, so she shows my headshot to prospective girls and their moms. She relays their extremely hurtful comments to me, and I am starting to think she knows how devastating it is to hear, and *wants* me to off myself. I realize the shame in being the only one of your friends whose son isn't married and has never had a girlfriend at 33. Financially I'm good, am average height, not fat, dress well, but my face, oh god.

Even when I avoid calling home and the awful thoughts start to go away, I'm bombarded with romance in almost every TV show or movie I watch, no matter how male-oriented. I'll be doing fine for weeks and then some love interest on the TV will send my mind into hysterics, never shutting up about dying. I might even just screw up at work, and my mind will just melt into a jumble of never-ending ""boil yourself alive you ugly dumb fuck"" thoughts.

I've tried hobbies, but the ones I've gotten into all involve people, and I can feel the disgust and hate, or sometimes sympathy, people have for me by looking at me - I've dealt with it my whole life, from being punched in the face and pinched as a toddler to being treated extremely coldly by teachers despite being extremely quiet and being top of my class. I even tried religion it's too fucking hard to get into paradise. I'd join my local Freemason Lodge but that involves a lot of speaking and it turns out I'm complete shit at that too.

Honestly the only thing stopping me, and it's quite big, is the work that'd go into it. I don't want anyone cleaning up the mess so it'd have to be in the ocean. And I'd have to clean out my apartment and find a place for everything. But lately I've been caring less about that all and a bottle of some illegal sedatives starts to sound pretty nice.

Surely there's some reason ugly people like me find to stay alive? How do they keep their mind off their ugliness? Any tips?

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",1,planning suicide longterm futureim depressed considering suicide soon maybe 45 years want kill kind long story main reasons combination black economic stability health problems family lack purpose inherent value life economic growing hard ive overcome lot adversity lowerincome household mother dying young age queer person color strict parents depression etc like lot people im college currently found genuinely love learning picked stem major college oppressive know makes sound like entitled world millennial parents flagship state school directly high school allowing choose different school years relatively good grades high school knew moment campus hated lack diversity friendship health negatively impacted didnt good sense direction idea major career felt inspired thought transferring didnt resources finances firstgeneration college student stuck depressed academically major department kinda shitty applied math im worried wont good paying job unlike engineering students like known earlier majored instead leave college net year 2528k loans family generally strongly dislike family life siblings went medical school basically left house fast mom died young age instead helping possible school selfsufficient dad remarried spends money new wife unemployed kids hes pretty old focusing retirement havent come queer worry family disown super religous super conservative strict familyoriented parents immigrants dont tons wealthy family health lot chronic probably geneticallycaused health diseases young young midteens able care parents employed supportive mom died dad didnt bother helping resources seeing specialists anymore health decreased hard college dont care didnt health insurance able health continues decrease arent lifethreatening health issues irreversible feel insecure selfconscious find hard justify continuing life kind nihilist definitely atheist absolutely belief afterlife dont want kill 34 years distant family meticulous suicideplanning im real world ive seen psychologists years rarely find helpful knowledgeable condescending statistically unlikely queer woman color firstgeneration college student background severly limited family support chronic health issues student loans economically secure like 5 years hard straight white male friends accepting uppermiddle class families succeed life constant struggle meand push find way misery whats point suffer struggle life dont reason basically created post agreed truly planning suicide futureim fine talking people choices andlor epanding reasons doubt people change mind tldr want wait 34 years committing suicide basically personally life worth living im economically secure supportive family friends generally healthy multitude comple reasons factors possible likely nihilist atheist dont point life society stigmatized suicide thinks everybody born continue living

But yet again, it was a trick of my mind. I was seduced by the lies, my brain clouded in deception, I got a glimpse of light. I had hope that things were going to get better, that I had a chance.


 But no. 


As a cruel twist of fate it was yet again ripped from my outstretched palms. All I want is to experience happiness. All I want  is to smile again. I just want to feel. 

But not this. Anything but this. 


Its a wicked trick. A twisted game.
 My broken brain torments me by offering me the only one thing I've every truly wanted. It waves it in front of my face, like an owner with food for a dog, and then it cackles in glee, as it takes it away again before I can even get a taste of the sweet bliss.


 And then there's nothing...


Until there's something


. All it takes is a raised voice. Being told I'm not good enough. Little things I've dealt with fine for so long. Even being told truths, that I know. And then it comes back. The pain so bad I fall to the floor, unable to scream or even move for that matter. Its clawing at my throat, I can feel my heart breaking again. I can feel the pain. And it hurts. It hurts so bad I decide I never want to feel again if this is all there is. If this is my only reward then what is the point in trying? I should just get it over with and do it. Its not that hard. I know how. I know how to make the pain stop. I'm back to crying myself to sleep at night, and carrying my water bottle everywhere with me to prevent the tears from spilling over once more. If anyone knows it'll just get worse. They feed on pain after all. And then... I wake up one day after a week, a month, heck sometimes a year of this torture and then there's... 


Nothing.


 The storm inside of me has stopped. Even though the sun is yet to shine through the thicket of clouds, I have hope. 


Stupid hope. 


How stupid do I have to be to realise that it's not over. Its never going to be over. I'm just in the eye of the storm. Stronger winds are on their way. They always get stronger. And so it goes on. The horrific loop I am yet to escape from. The twisted game I never agreed to play. And its never going to end. I can lie about it and fight it, some times I can even ignore it. But I know that there is no way to win this game. The only way I'll ever be free is if If I beat the final boss. And who is the final boss you might ask?  


The final boss,


 is  me.",1,thought getting better trick mind seduced lies brain clouded deception got glimpse light hope things going better chance cruel twist fate ripped outstretched palms want eperience happiness want smile want feel wicked trick twisted game broken brain torments offering thing ive truly wanted waves face like owner food dog cackles glee takes away taste sweet bliss theres theres takes raised voice told im good little things ive dealt fine long told truths know comes pain bad fall floor unable scream matter clawing throat feel heart breaking feel pain hurts hurts bad decide want feel reward point trying hard know know pain stop im crying sleep night carrying water bottle prevent tears spilling knows itll worse feed pain wake day week months heck year torture theres storm inside stopped sun shine thicket clouds hope stupid hope stupid realise going im eye storm stronger winds way stronger goes horrific loop escape twisted game agreed play going end lie fight times ignore know way win game way ill free beat final boss final boss ask final boss

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

871,"Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

I appreciate your consideration.",1,suicide watch dui arrest referred subreddit highly applicable dont mean deflect im asking friend hes great guys simply carries lot baggage contet current question friend member armed forces united states american eperience difficult accept taken toll psychologically previously ecellent athletes centralized lifestyle marijuana nicotine alcohol attend university college town returned spring break yesterday afternoon night drove blood alcohol concentration 02 received morning father asking ensure doesnt act drastically legal action required promptly fear absence vehicle impounded allow dwell thoughts fault owns guns stability primary concern staying household overnight friends stop day foresee longterm fi acknowledged circumstances constructive manner frustrated grasping consequences actions closing great character solely baggage carries weighs point wants quit continuation perceived actions night justification told define night hoping acquire knowledge personal eperience better provide encouragement appreciate consideration

880,"1. I understand that collaboration between people is vital to innovate new things that can benefit the society we live in. In other words, if the communication is strictly about work & to achieve common goals, it’s superb and I support it wholeheartedly.

2. I also understand socializing on the internet forums and communities since you have more time to think and analyze questions and reply more thoroughly (also anonymity). It’s insightful and you leave footprints so that anyone who has a similar question can read up previous discussions and later offer insights or move on if the answer was satisfactory. 

3. I understand having fun alone because there’s no point in sharing those moments with others since no one fully understands what others experience. You always experience everything in solitude. Do we need to have someone by our side to feel our happiness better? Or do we lie to ourselves? I don’t feel like sharing my happiness with others since it’s mine. Even if I do so, you can only share the glimpse of it and I don’t see the need of expressing something that can’t be fully communicated.

What I don’t understand is:

1. Having fun in the physical world where everything seems pretentious, unfruitful and a total waste of time. I mean, I’ve had great discussions with people but it never has the same or a better high. Communicating with the same people over and over eventually leads to dullness and mediocrity. 

What should be the goal of meeting up and talking & discussing common interests rather than deepening our knowledge about then? Isn’t everything else just a distraction from the inevitable? That we are going to die? Or our wrongdoings will destroy us before the natural death from old age?

By common interests I mean what involves all of us. Global warming, politics, technology, science and our struggles. In other words, I understand communication and collaboration if it’s for the sake of the society’s well-being.

I feel like wasting my time when I’m with other people. It’s all so weird how similarly every conversation starts and ends. It feels like in the physical word everyone wants to gain something from a social situation. Ego boost, status, sex, pity, approval, etc.

The internet is freer from this hideousness and it feels like people are more open to sincere collaboration than in real life.

Am I missing something? Real life socializing, outgoing, drinking, sex, love - is this all a lie? Pretentious? Self-centered? 

I have been isolating more and more lately and I don’t know if there’s something I am missing. 

I am a highly-functional person with highly-developed social skills to blend and properly function in the society I live in. I’ve been faking to be a valuable society member for a long time and pretentiously giving friends & family what is expected from me which I never thought to have any significance unlike them.

There quite a few mods, but it doesn't take that long to set up (he has a drive link that has them all in one folder). Would anybody be interested? You can get the mods and server info for the server by joining a discord server. You can try the code posted below, but if that doesn't work - no worries.

* The server is a factions/anarchy server, so things are pretty lax as far as rules go
* NO BALE FIRE BOMBS. We have a nuclear warfare mod and for Pete's sake, please don't use the bale fire bomb. You probably won't get banned, but you may get some screams of panic when you see how vastly horrible it is

888,"It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past ""anniversary"" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed.

Having a visible disability is embarrassing and I never want to leave the house again.

I have never been told that I don't look disabled.  My disability is VISIBLE.  I literally have a different face and body shape.  On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.

I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled.  It's a COMPLIMENT to me.  It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded.  Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?  I'd rather just be told that I am too beautiful and intelligent to be disabled and not get any help whatsoever than be called retarded.

I don't know if this is the right sub but I would just like to get this out of the way and maybe learn something from you guys. I'm 19 years old, I've been feeling really lonely for about 5 years now, I try to avoid people myself, I don't know why, I feel like I can't form long term relationships. On the one hand I have a group of friends, I go to parties sometimes, but I always pretend that everything is fine, I don't talk too much and I avoid people, I don't know why. I've had a few love objects in my life, but nothing ever came out of it. Because of my ""fucked up"" attitude, I had to change schools twice because I couldn't commit, I was afraid to go there and even though I was probably liked, I didn't feel it and I was just afraid, I had a weird attitude. The loneliness was killing me, I kept going back to my decisions and thinking ""why the fuck did I do that"". Finally a year ago it all got to me, I wanted to commit suicide, to hang myself, but at the last minute I was saved. I cry often, just like that and my whole life appears before my eyes. Many times I've tried to do something, to go to the gym, to get away from it all, to think, but I always come back to one point when I just can't do anything and again I just think about ending my life, I don't see the point in it. I've never talked to any therapist, but looking at the level of them in my country, I think it won't help me. There are many more things that I don't think I can write about right now. I don't know what to do, I just wanted to get it out here and maybe seek some advice from people.",1,#200b dont know right sub like way maybe learn guys im 19 years old ive feeling lonely 5 years try avoid people dont know feel like cant form long term relationships hand group friends parties pretend fine dont talk avoid people dont know ive love objects life came fucked attitude change schools twice couldnt commit afraid probably liked didnt feel afraid weird attitude loneliness killing kept going decisions thinking fuck finally year ago got wanted commit suicide hang minute saved cry like life appears eyes times ive tried gym away think come point cant think ending life dont point ive talked therapist looking level country think wont help things dont think write right dont know wanted maybe seek advice people

951," 

   A bit of background here: I'm 26, for a year I've been working as a delivery guy, my life isn't terrible compared to what it used to be, but still I feel like I won't be able to escape my past no matter what I do, that's why I gave up seeking friends, relationship is out of discussion.  
Since 16 my life's been going downhill. I started hanging out with people that had a very bad influence on me, resulting in dropping out high school and seeking opportunities in drug trade. At 19 I was arrested for drug sale and possession, spent 3 years in prison. After I got out, my life was still spiralling out of control: I wasn't able to leave my drug life behind and became addicted to heroin and almost died from a OD. I've been in a rehab centre for almost two years. I attempted suicide twice whilst being there, if it wasn't for the vigilant eyes of the staff I'd be gone.  
Eventually I made some progress, got released and once again I had to face the outside world.   
Since then it's been tremendously difficult for me to open up to someone about my past, but even more difficult to find a job having a criminal record. Like I said earlier I've been working as a delivery guy for a year now, I'm very grateful to my boss who decided to give me a chance and hire me, also probably the only good thing I did when I was younger was getting a driver's license which is a game changer at this moment.  
I didn't dare thinking about making friends because that could distract me from being productive at work but more than I'm just to afraid of what people would think about me, if they're going to judge me if I eventually tell them about my past.  
At first I thought about  opening up to at least one person but as time passes I realise I'd probably be on my own my whole life.  
It's not just my past, a lot of things have changed in society and I was completely gone from this world, I feel like I missed out so many great things in the past 6 or 7 years. I can't talk about a movie, TV or video game that came out in recent years because I never experienced it. One thing that I always liked was watching football but the enjoyment isn't the same knowing I missed so many great games that happened previously. When someone attempts to chit-chat with me I literally don't know what subject to bring up, I just let them talk about themselves and nod my head. Social media is not appealing to me, it actually makes me feel more miserable when I see people I used to know being successful and having a family, while I'm only having a year of employment.  
My life is slowly but surely becoming a mundane existence, I only work, eat, sleep and avoid any human interaction other than the one I'm suppose to do at work. I have a 8hrs shift but I usually work more than that with no extra pay. It's not like I have to, my boss actually insists that I only do my regular shift, but I keep telling him I must repay the government for all those years I've been a burden to the system. It's some kind of form to seek absolution. That isn't necessarily a lie it's just that I don't really have anything else better to do. Last Friday I had a 14hrs shift and didn't even feel bad about it. I earn enough, only spend my money on food and bills, I don't have to pay rent hence I live in my parents' house(they passed away few years ago).  
Lately my mental health has slightly deteriorated knowing I have to face this loneliness every day. I have no one to talk to, all the people I knew are no longer available or have better things to do than talking to a wreck who reached out to them after all these years. I know there might be people who went through similar experiences but I can drag myself to search for them, I feel like I will never find a person to resonate with.   
I tried my best to take care of myself, in three months I'll be two years of drug free, sometimes I exercise, always keep my house clean and spend more time on the internet trying to catch up on all the things I missed. I really don't want to rely on antidepressants to improve my mental health I'm afraid of the effects they might have on me. But again I feel like the past will always haunt me. I'm so afraid of other's reaction and judgment.Recently I noticed this tendency of canceling someone based on what they're said or done years or even decades ago. If I'll ever be in a better position than today and someone would digg up my past they'll probably crucify me and this chills me to the bone.

1061,"I feel so hopelessHello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5
Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind.

1076,"Hi. I'm in a really bad hole right now. I had a fight with my stepmom, one of hundreds we've had in my life. To put it short, she was extremely emotionally and mentally abusive to me growing up (she came into my life when I was 7, I'm 23 now). She said a lot of fucked up stuff to me as a kid. Things that still fuck with me, and have probably contributed to my lack of commitment/trust with people. 

I brought up a thing she said to me years ago. She told me, as I was on my way out the door on my way to school, trying to escape an argument, ""You'll be the reason your dad and I ever break up."" I didn't really get it at the time, besides getting the message that I was unwanted. That feeling has followed me through my entire life. So I brought it up to her just an hour ago. She vehemently denied that she would ever have said that to me, and said ""how dare you accuse me of that"". Then stormed out of my room eluding to me needing help for my mental health and that I made it all up. 

This is the closest I've been to crying in probably a year, since my last mental breakdown that had me screaming at somebody that I wanted to die (that's another issue, I'm pretty fucked up and definitely need therapy.) I'm still not *able to* cry, but I feel really shitty right now. And now I'm wondering if it really was something she said, or if my brain is just so messed up that I fabricated it all. I would believe that if it weren't for the fact that there are multiple different instances of shit like that happening that I remember vividly. 

Anyway, I feel like a waste of breath right now and don't have the mental energy to even go back to my new job tomorrow. I feel like no one in my life is honest about the way they feel about me, and that no one wants me or cares. And I'm on reddit trying to get through to a single person, hoping to see a string of text on the screen reassuring me from someone I don't know.

1083,"My mom died a month ago after a long battle with cancer. I talk about her everyday, I think about calling her everyday, there is nothing, no level of pain comparable to having the one person who has always loved you disappearing off the face of the planet. I don't want life to go on, I don't know how to keep doing this right now. 

I had a boyfriend that I finally allowed myself to lean on and he told me he didn't want a relationship with me anymore on my birthday. I came to spend time with him by coming early to school, now I'm sitting alone in a dorm room feeling more alone than I ever have. I don't have anyone with me, and anyone across the way can't do much. 

I keep thinking of things I would tell my mom, how I could've shown her the door tags I made for my residents or how I organized the bookshelves 

I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I thought I could get through anything just to break down at a wooden desk in a single room. I'm tired of people telling me I'm strong, and I don't want to tell anyone around me that I don't know what to do anymore. What's the point? Is there a point to going forward when I look at every car passing by, every pencil mark I make, and the thought pops into my head, ""This will just be a distant memory before I die"". It's so haunting, its painful. 

I thought about this all day. Writing this out all day as I tried to do tasks to keep myself busy. The room's a mess, I didn't want to cook or drive to eat anything, I'm not tired but I feel like I'm wasting time just sitting here. What am I here for?

1094,"Concerned for a friend, our conversation has left me shaken up.I want to start from the beginning, I apologize early on if the information is not needed. I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly. Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird. 


I play online video games quite a lot. This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot. Except for one of my friends who we will call James. We have talked and played together for a little over a year now. This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us. We text/call each other and even video chat on the occasion. James is 19 and lives in another state than I. 


Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts. He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before, but was saved, and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself. 


It all started a about 6 months ago, when he got together with this woman, they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy. He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love. When they broke up he was very depressed, the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated. We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even. Finally, some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again. 


Just 2 weeks ago, he decided to try dating again. He met a girl via a dating app. They talked non stop, which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away. They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great. He was talking about how much he loved her (I don't know if he told her that) and how she could be the one he marries. I didn't want to ruin his fun, as it was nice to see him happy, so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that. 


They broke up yesterday. He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn't get the text for another hours. All it said was ""I need someone right now"". I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened. I gave him a call, no answer. I text him, no answer, so I called him again and he answered, saying he was at a friends getting drunk. I asked if he was okay, and he explained to me what happened. They broke up because ""her mom told her she didn't want them to be together"". He pretty much hung up on me, so I decided to give him space, as he clearly didn't want to talk about it. 


Today, when I asked him if he wanted to play any games (I didn't want to bug him about what happened). He said he would, so we got on and played for about 20 minutes before he left to go play a different game. After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated. He asked to play, so I hopped on the game and joined him. I asked him if he was drunk, he said he was. I could tell. 


This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much, he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday. He was slurring his speech, making incoherent sentences, etc. Then he (very casually) says he wants to ""blow his brains out"". It took me by surprise and I asked him why. He says he was in pain, saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore. I got more and more concerned as he spoke. I had no idea what to say. I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that, so I asked him if he was serious, why he was going to do it. He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn't deserve to live anymore. 


I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him, his family and friends would, etc. Anything I could think of to say to him. He just shot everything down, saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends (including me) could ""fuck off and go to hell"" because he will be dead and won't have to deal with the consequences of his death. I pretty much was left crying my eyes out, left not knowing what to say. All I could say was ""your life matters to me, and I would be upset if you died"". After repeatedly saying he didn't care, he finally says ""do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you? No i wouldn't be"". 


He basically started to lash out against me, and I had nothing left to say. He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say. Right now, I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk. He didn't respond and just logged off of the game. Hasn't answered my texts or calls. It's not my fault I have to go to work and can't listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night. But I did offer to listen while I was at work. 


I honestly have no idea what to do anymore. I'm not sure how serious his threats were, and I have no idea where he lives, no contact other than his cell phone number. I don't know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage.

1110,"I can't speak.Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

I don't think it will be very long now until I take the plunge.",1,cant speakever child ive stutter mild think kings speech hits closer home spent school life listening chat laugh sing whisper sit classroom allocated spot table hearing questions thrown room knew answer wanting moment craved raise hand answer like normal school boy couldnt instead sit impenetrable silent bubble id found daydream future adult happy life stutter noneistent years later im adult mediocre job great friends im lucky family friends colleagues know affliction mundane speech impediment needs little longer words assume people speak fluently articulatory hindrance dont understand realise mental emotional turmoil create day age based communication want apply job sit hour people answer questions want spend free precious time filling cheeses aisle si pennies need cancel subscribing buy house doctors appointment ring hang think cant simple hello want shops buy new coffee machine nice lady walks asks need help today completely unaware battle raging deep inside struggling breathe facial contortions colour shifting milky white beetroot red aware millisecond passes words come finally realise looking funny hint fear degrading humiliating emasculating knowing sound mind trying life need speak think wrong head avoid friendly looking chap standing toasters regret walking acting normal worse hardest thing stutter cant tell people whats going realise waking hour life dedicated stutter looming choice invisible disease eating away confidence inside shallow husk remains filled aniety lost dreams opportunities life worth living watching peers progress better life cant phone hung suicide different reality far away unrealistic properly time goes bleak future life dont think long plunge

1133,"Just When I Think I'm In The Clear...I was so sure I was over this.  But, goodness, this new bout I slammed into is, by far, the worst I've felt in a long time.  I understand we're all trapped in our own heads, but I've never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days.  I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.

And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It's terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.  All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?""  It just doesn't seem like the case.  Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it.  I've failed to adapt to society and the world.

Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers.  This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that.  I just don't want to hurt anyone.  I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child.  But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out.

1143,"I'm going to kill myself by the end of this monthI'm a 19 f. I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.

I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.

1148,"This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved - part 4This has just happened to me today.

Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go ""bitch - pleeassseee""

Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them, self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger. 

It's not that I plan to kill myself, but instantaneously I think in my head ""I want to kill myself"" and immediately next thought I would think ""OMG don't be stupid, that's not going to happen"". That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. 

The problem here is now I don't really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. 

What happened today was I bitched to a ""friend"" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say ""friend"" because I'm not venting to them because it's my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn't very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)

I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I'll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn't even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).

So back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. 

After lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. 

OK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. 

The police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I'd self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven't sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.

They have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could've contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)

The point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn't think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could've done so against my will. 

There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of  ""care"" or ""worry"" who says they are doing things that they are not. It's hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn't right. It's just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.

I'm slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). 
Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can't do anything else - it's the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren't going to just blindly listen to that ""story"", and going to the hospital doesn't mean that they'll keep you there against your will.

Why did my work place decide to lie? I don't know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn't matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.

As for my ""friend"". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he'd shrug it off. I've told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he's pretending he's a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I'd make sure he gets haunted by it.

I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more (thinking I could get back at them)",1,eperience thinking suicide dobbed workplace gets involved happened today staying home work got email work bitch pleeassseee work conflicts basically caused mentally ill point frustrated self harm thoughts come hand hand irritation anger plan kill instantaneously think head want kill immediately net thought think omg dont stupid thats going happened sort goes backwards forth worked feels crazy head feels need vent problem dont care asides basically bitching happened today bitched friend work personal email work email friend im venting best friend know personally work knows instances thought self harm work isnt trustworthy find bitch bit told thinking moment bits people lying want kill feel faint forth time told fact told locked bathroom work got scared ill self harm went outside literally read didnt check alright come check literally upstairs anyways point story normal main story wrote emails early morning went home watched went sleep lunch parents started phoning saying work contacted work phoned police ok sure time work phoned police fuck police came knew work phoned telling sent email saying id self harm suicide worried havent sent contact worried alive mied truths lies sent email true bit big deal lie phone calls emails day couldve contacted wanted phone parents said contact want phone police big deal point fine got taken hospital check got let day doctors didnt think reasons couldve going people hide facade care worry says things hard tell people want loved want believe told true feel worse hearing isnt right better trust instincts people let betray trust im slowly getting people think mi lies people believe like history mental illness seen psychologist stories send police place sent hospital assessment police literally cant doctors decided doctors hospital arent going blindly listen story going hospital doesnt mean theyll work place decide lie dont know genuinely worried covering ass case legal problems want place nuisance doesnt matter mental mental friend coping fact care company wellbeing honestly believe died hed shrug ive told feeling suicidal endless amounts times getting personal messages like whatsapp emails forward work cope makes think self harm want kill wanting watch die wanting regret helping gets pretends fault panic attack walked away telling help actually time hes pretending hes good guy cares help shit hits fans like human version workplace kill id sure gets haunted upset workplace lied think suicide thinking

1154,"Hi /r/depression

My partner suffers from depression and recently decided to ramp down and off medication from heavy episode of depression last year.

My partner is stable but now hovering along the lines of bad/negative mood often. It’s wearing me down to be around self-hate and negativity.

I was thinking of suggesting couples therapy but I’m afraid that will spiral my partner. I also don’t know how to suggest it without triggering abandonment fears.

I could use some resources or tips for support partners struggling to manage in a situation where we’re both at home together constantly.

I’ll delete if this is the wrong place to ask this.

Thanks.",1,hi r depression partner suffers depression recently decided ramp medication heavy episode depression years partner stable hovering lines bad negative mood wearing selfhate negativity thinking suggesting couples therapy im afraid spiral partner dont know suggest triggering abandonment fears use resources tips support partners struggling manage situation home constantly ill delete wrong place ask thanks

1157,"I feel ugly, and it makes me feel like I have less value as a person.I deal with body dysmorphia. Not that the things I see don't exist, but I realize that I obsess over my appearance more than most people do.

I find myself hideous. My face slants. It's fucked up that I couldn't just have a normal face. Doesn't have to be gorgeous. But I mean, my whole fucking face slants to the side. Logically, I know that people probably don't care. But I constantly think about when I am talking to people. I see it. I obsess over plastic surgery. I obsess over ways to make it less noticeable. It's going to cost around $20-30,000 if I want to fix it. Part of the problem is I have a cross under bite. So it makes my jaw slant to the left. But then I have a droopy eye. Which looks more apparent because of the slanted jaw. If I want to get the eye fixed that's around $3-5000. Even my fucking ears are slanted. My face looks like I had bell's palsy, but without the complete loss of muscle movement in the side of my face. 

These things aren't in my head. I wish I had full on body dysmorphia where I just see things that aren't real. I've posted on /r/rateme and people have pointed out exactly the things I see. When I was a kid and got my ears pierced at the mall, they said they normally would pierce one ear a little higher and the other a little lower to make them look symmetrical. However, my ears are so crooked that they couldn't even do that. You can't even surgically fix crooked ears.  Today I went and got botox, and the lady recommended that I get microblading for my eyebrows because it would make my eye look less droopy. Which of course I'm going to do (but not with her), because if I can make myself look less crooked for a couple hundred bucks then yes I'm going to do it. Beats the several thousand. 


My family thinks I'm vain. Which I guess I am. But you know, that's pretty freaking easy for them to say. Somehow I was the only one born with a half smashed face. I'm the ugly duckling. But I'm superficial because I want to get work done to make myself look normal. 

I understand that I'm being shallow. Of course people still will talk to me even if I'm ugly. I'm great at making friends. But you know what I'm not good at? Getting guys I love to stay. They move on to much prettier girls. I'm the girl they date while they have low self-esteem. I have a nice body. I'm the girl they want to hit and quit. You bang the body, but you marry for the face. 

I just don't think I'll be at peace in my head until I get the surgeries done. But I can't afford them. Sure, you'll probably tell me that it won't make me happy. I call bull shit. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder. I hated my body. I hated my thighs and wanted that coveted thigh gap. Now, years later, I work out, and like I said, I have a good body with curves. But I also now have that coveted thigh gap. And you know what? I fucking love it. It makes me feel good that I can stand with my feet together and my thighs don't touch. Dumb that I put so much value on it? Yeah, probably. But it rings true that if I fixed my other physical flaws that it would make me feel better too.",1,feel ugly makes feel like value person deal body dysmorphic things dont eist realize obsess appearance people find hideous face slants fucked couldnt normal face doesnt gorgeous mean fucking face slants logically know people probably dont care constantly think talking people obsess plastic surgery obsess ways noticeable going cost 2030 000 want fi problem cross bite makes jaw slant left droopy eyes looks apparent slanted jaw want eye fied thats 35000 fucking ears slanted face looks like bells palsy complete loss muscle movement face things arent head wish body dysmorphic things arent real ive posted r rateme people pointed eactly things kid got ears pierced mall said normally pierce ear little higher little lower look symmetrical ears crooked couldnt cant surgically fi crooked ears today went got boto lady recommended microblading eyebrows eye look droopy course im going look crooked couple bucks yes im going beats thousand family thinks im vain guess know thats pretty freaking easy born half smashed face im ugly duckling im superficial want work look normal understand im shallow course people talk im ugly im great making friends know im good getting guys love stay prettier girls im girl date low selfesteem nice body im girl want hit bang body marry face dont think ill peace head surgeries cant afford sure youll probably tell wont happy bull shit younger eating disorder hated body hated thighs wanted coveted thigh gap years later work like said good body curves coveted thigh gap know fucking love makes feel good stand feet thighs dont touch dumb value yeah probably rings true fied physical flaws feel better

People would see that I was only 24 and wonder what happened. *Was it a car accident? The poor dear probably had something terminal. It’s a shame to see someone die so young.*

Is it? I’m 24 years old and I don’t remember what it’s like to be normal. This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world. The anxiety is constant and the panic attacks even happen when I’m sleeping. The doctor’s office smelled like Lysol and the nurse didn’t mind when I cried. The white pills make me drowsy and the small green ones make me sweat. I can’t stop grinding my teeth but they say I’m getting better now.

I accept that I’m dying and offer this as my final testament: Paradise is understanding. Words are better wasted than unspoken.  I would have named my daughter Adeline. I can’t stop grinding my teeth and I would have named my daughter Adeline.

1303,"\[17m, a bit of complaining... yeah\]

&#x200B;

I feel like I haven't done anything with my life lately (the past year or so). Whether it is anything productive such as pursuing my education or smaller events such as watching a tv show I have been meaning to catch up on, there has always been a small voice at the back of my head telling me that I am wasting my time, and this is not what I should be doing.  At this point, doing anything short of laying in bed all day and sleeping feels like a monumental mental task which I have to consciously force myself to even begin. For the past month or two, I have spent about every day either sleeping for 15+ hours or staring at the ceiling for hours on end.  I try my best to get out of bed when I eventually wake up but oftentimes, I never proceed any further beyond that. I end up feeling indecisive about completing any basic task such as brushing my teeth or watering my plants to the point I end up doing nothing and returning to my bed.

1311,"I did everything I was told to do. For years. It doesn't workAnyone who looks at my post history can probably tell this is a venting account, and as people can see,I have been like this for a very long time. Ever since I stopped being a Christian back in the mid 2010s

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

I don't have much more to say. I'm sorry. This is so dumb. Everyone says to find a purpose. But that doesn't matter when rape, viruses, and murder surround us.

1312,"LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start?

1329,"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 

So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. 

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it.

I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.

I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.

I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.

I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.

My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said ""I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself."" and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.

I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 

I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.

I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.

Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.

I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.

I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.

1385,"I'm patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic, but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old, I jump to ""dramatic"" conclusions quickly. I've been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I've realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials. 
Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn't afford all of this. My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit. 
On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it. 
I've heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn't completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments. Don't really want to think about it right now but I'll do it anyways. My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I'm on my own.
I'm not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die. I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic. Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can't afford.

1415,"I was emotionally abused for wanting to change schools, I failed high school, went on an exchange and got grounded by my host family, failed university preparation, was kicked from a club 4 times, dropped from a degree multiple times, struggled at a grocery store job, and smashed plenty of relationships from impulsive decisions. It turned out I had undiagnosed ADHD.

At each stage of life, my mother and I had disagreements on the direction of my life. She responded by emotionally abusing me. This happened each year from ages 15-18. At first, I learnt to embrace it, stating my wants and needs then letting the situation escalate. Later I learnt she plays nice when a counsellor gets involved, so I'd speak to her, she'd scream me down, then I'd involve a counsellor. This still affects me daily at 25.

I was going to commit suicide and a late-diagnosed ADHD read my story. He said it sounded like ADHD, so I saw psychiatrists who agree. I have ASD and ADHD.

Ritalin has made a clear difference for ADHD. I feel like myself. I felt like study and employment weren't options for me, now it does. I've been more productive. One of the big issues I had was whispering/talking/yelling to myself. I couldn't stop and nobody would hire me. Now it stopped. The trauma thoughts quietened down a lot.

[Long version here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latediagnosisadhd/comments/onxytn/my_story_failed_high_school_university/).

With the late diagnosis and effective medication comes a lot of thinking about myself, about others, about society.

I was discriminated against my whole life for something I didn't understand. Realising how different I am, and thinking about that impacted me negatively, can be quite isolating.

Developing CPTSD, starting 2 unwanted degrees against my will, cutting off my family, and a lot of wounds, smashed relationships and opportunities, difficulty with study and employment until I get a proper diagnosis was all non-negotiables for me.

I saw counsellors my whole life and nobody helped me in a meaningful way. It took a fucking Reddit comment to make sense of my life. What the fuck.

I've had my mother abuse me into submission with counsellors stepping in. I've had a meme group accuse me of crimes I didn't do, the same dude ended up getting in trouble for pressuring a woman into sex. I've had a far-left anarchist dig up old offensive messages, track down someone's home, and make up allegations about me to try to take me out. I've had a friend get convicted of sexual misconduct, another try send me legal threats and later turned out to be a domestic abuser against his partner, one mocked me for attempting suicide and likely will be an elected politician in the future. One dude I was good friends with ended being fully radicalised, had the police visit him, has a whole news article dedicated to him. He video called me talking about wanting to spark a revolution against Islam. I cut him off eventually.

The way you can tell something was up with me is most people could tell from afar to avoid these people. That it sounds like bad news. I didn't. I would repeatedly get involved, get burned, and not get the signal. I think this is probably part of ADHD, brain fog, not thinking much about consequences.

I've been hurt and attempts to ruin my life from both family and others. I've never gotten a sincere apology from anyone. Nobody has personal accountability even when confronted on it. I just maneuvered people to back off and show there will be consequences for messing with me. This seems to be the most meaningful way to move people.

I think people overall are self-interested, uncaring, and are more concerned about their appearance than their character. People want to look good, not be good. I've been treated like shit by counsellors for wanting to get help. I don't trust the politicians who claim to represent me to actually care. I've lost faith in other people. I don't trust others. I get judged for the stupid shit I've done in the past and people judge me for where my life has gone. ""Behind in life"" fuck you, try dealing with all my shit.

As the cost of housing rises, as the planet gets worse, as it is getting harder to just get by, I'm not sure if I even want to be on this planet. The world is cruel and uncaring. I don't really have much motivation to be here much longer.

But I have a lot of social support. I'm getting an ADHD coach. I'm working towards getting a job. I'm learning to drive. I'm moving ahead. But I feel subdued. I want to shelter myself from people.

1419,"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" — William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

I hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it.",0,british school lunches thy nourishment thy sustenance william shakespeare food served school unhealthy gobble cant digest junk properly consumption dry greasy wedges timeconsuming process especially dont want cancer meticulously remove burnt parts furthermore factor initial time needed mentally prepare youre meals monastic silence im finish time arrive class following period chewing hands peers elaborate conversations newfangled claptrap currently popular minutes green plastic trays hypotheses eplain phenomenon eercising jaws speech increases chewing performance results loud alpha male female eats food time use cutlery pulverise food inhale pause breath words eat messily large proportion food ends like ceiling fan guy brings lunch home differentsized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched slices white bread diet assume developed professional meet unique nutritional needs utter lack hygiene older generations complain weve killed napkin industry ones dont provide assert eating important maths history sufficient time allocated

I have no goals, I’m a Christian without faith and can’t find the point to living anymore. I’m 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day “what’s the point of being here?” I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isn’t a new question, it’s been haunting me for about 6 years and I don’t know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesn’t help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they’re necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

I’m just taking a random course to begin with so I don’t even know why I’m even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

It’s not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it’s a privilege. But I just can’t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don’t know how my friends or non-family would take it

1430,"I totally hate it when my family keeps asking me or telling me (believing that they're doing a great job encouraging me) to take up things that come their way. 

All they say is ""you're intelligent, if you take this up it'll be awesome, you'd do a great job"" or ""stop hiding away from everything, keep running away from things, how long you want to keep avoiding things"" this puts me under immense pressure and guilt. Just to make them feel better or not wanting to disappoint them, I force myself to accept whatever job related tasks they make me do.

The problem is that they believe I'm intelligent and maybe I actually am, at least, to some extent, but sometimes I feel really dumb unable to even utter a proper, coherent sentence. I forget to speak the language and I feel like an inefficient teenager trapped in a so-called adult's body. My body language gets me embarrassed and I get intimidated by intelligent folks. I don't want to make a fool of myself.

I'd be happy to do anything that doesn't put me in the spotlight. I'm more of a behind-the-desk worker (unfortunately the act of 'educating' doesn't come with this privilege) than a forward, spontaneous one.

I'm sinking in a ton of my own guilt and embarrassment whenever I decline. There are so many young ones out there who are making so much much money and have a good profile and here I am rotting away like dead meat even though I'm young too. 

I'm not focusing only on my negatives but they are overpowering my positive attributes. I've taken up such things and have spent many sleepless nights, anxiety and have put myself through so much. I don't want to be struggling with the simple things that others seem to be doing without any care. 

If I even think about dressing up to face something or meet any (seemingly) intelligent adults, I feel like a goat being taken for slaughter (apologies. couldn't think of anything better).

I can't get help, I can't tell my family, it's like I've fallen into a quicksand but there are too many things ahead of me preventing me from seeking help...

This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasn’t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didn’t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didn’t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I don’t believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

What can I do to make him feel better on his birthday? His school does nothing for birthdays. Every time I talk to him about it he starts to tear up and either leaves the room or changes the subject.

1502,"Ever since I got sober (DOS: 11/12/19) ive had this problem; when I don’t have a woman in my life, everything is dull, my intrusive thoughts get much worse, I get more angry over small things, and my overall quality of life is 10x less than when I have a gf. Recently my girlfriend of 9 months broke up with me out of the blue, and things were really bad for about a week. When I was at work, I was running the register and I got this really cute girls number. We started chatting, and things were looking good. She told me how she can’t do relationships right now for a valid reason that I understand that I’m not going to get into for privacy reasons. Our friendship is still good, and I appreciate having her in my life, but since she said that I’ve been slowly slipping back into that bad place again. Thankfully, thoughts of getting high aren’t very active, but I keep picturing myself playing with guns, pointing them at my head, etc; and I’ve been thinking about ending it more and more frequently. My medication isn’t really helping anymore, just helps me sleep, and my doctor doesn’t want to change them while I’m in a bad place because it’s a serious gamble and he wants to wait till I’m in a better place mentally to change it. 

I don’t like having women play this much into my mental state. I can’t keep living like this. I have no drive to get up and do things anymore. I stopped playing call of duty because it doesn’t make me feel anything anymore. I only have been able to make myself eat once a day because I don’t get hungry anymore. I have been vaping a lot more it it doesn’t make me feel anything anymore, just makes me not want to hit again. I’ve been fighting with my mom more and sometimes I think about hitting her when I’m angry. I’m becoming more and more desperate for female attention and sex, but all attempts to far have failed miserably. 

Last night, as I was falling asleep in my deeply medicated babble, I remember picturing I was talking to the girl from work, saying “I don’t care if your a lit grenade, waiting to explode. I just want to hold you” (I know it sounds dumb, but this is as close to talking to my subconscious as it gets.)

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I can remember wanting to kill my self as far back as 4th grade, but it’s never been this bad before. Today was my first day off in 5 days and all I’ve done is lie in bed, In My filthy room and watch YouTube and play gta on and off. None of my coping skills are working anymore. 

All advice is accepted, and all replies will be read. Anything helps.",1,got sober dose 11 12 19 ive problem dont woman life dull intrusive thoughts worse angry small things overall quality life si recently girlfriend 9 months broke blue things bad week work running register got cute girls number started chatting things looking good told cant relationships right valid reason understand im going privacy reasons friendship good appreciate having life said ive slowly slipping bad place thankfully thoughts getting high arent active picturing playing guns pointing head etc ive thinking ending frequently medication isnt helping anymore helps sleep doctor doesnt want change im bad place gamble wants wait till im better place mentally change dont like having women play mental state cant living like drive things anymore stopped playing duty doesnt feel anymore able eat day dont hungry anymore vaping lot doesnt feel anymore makes want hit ive fighting mom think hitting im angry im desperate female attention se attempts far failed miserably night falling asleep deeply medicated babble remember picturing talking girl work saying dont care lit grenade waiting eplode want hold know sounds dumb close talking subconscious gets dont know dont want feel way anymore remember wanting kill self far ith grade bad today day 5 days ive lie bed filthy room watch youtube play ga coping skills working anymore advice accepted replies ready helps

I don't have the guts to do it. I'm too afraid of regret if I do anything drastic. That's why I constantly wish I'll die suddenly and unexpected, out of my control. I'd be so contempt with that. Every time I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up. Passing away while dreaming is a dream.

Life would be so great if I could make all my problems go away, but, as everyone knows, life is not that simple. So I want to die. I don't want to face my problems.

I love bed time and look forward to it and take 2 naps a day. I feel disappointed when I wake up in the morning and stress out that I need to get through another day.

Its gives me a little break from the constant negative thoughts and reality. We also have a new puppy which I thought would make me feel better but it is so exhausting and I feel as though I am resenting having it around.

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

I'm 24 and I am a pharmacy student. The place where I live and my social skills - or lack thereof - don't allow me to get my hands on opioids, or other ways of dying peacefully. 

I'm not here to talk about why I want this. I know many of you know the feeling.

I just don't want to do it and fail and have to face family after that, or live with permanent brain damage. Please message me if comments are not allowed.

1550,"my 16 year old son is adamantly refusing to attend school. he insists that he wants to be a ""NEET"" (not in employment, education, or training) and has no need for an education or job. we have tried to use positive and negative reinforcement with him (rewarding him for cooperation and confiscating electronics when he misbehaves) but he doesn't seem to give a shit about anything. after being technologically deprived, he will proceed to lie in bed for the entire day, staring at the ceiling. 

for context, he has major depressive disorder and is seeing a therapist and on meds. we have asked him what he wants to do in the future - what interests he wants to pursue - and his answer is always ""nothing."" he has no zest for life whatsoever. 

it wasn't always this way. he used to be an avid artist and pianist, as well as a straight A student. this year, he has fallen into a debilitating downward spiral and has quit all his former activities. he threatens that he will run away from home if we enroll him into school this year. 

we're not certain what caused his sudden abhorrence for school, but we're guessing it stemmed from his psych ward stay in april. he'd been in inpatient care for a week due to suicidal ideation. as a result, he missed a chunk of school and fell behind on assignments. this hit him hard, and he decided to give up altogether on academics. 

we have no idea what to do with him. in our state, it is against the law to drop out of school before the age of 18. it's a week before enrollment day, and we have yet to get him on board with attending school.",1,16 year old son adamantly refusing attend school insists wants neet employment education training need education job tried use positive negative reinforcement rewarding cooperation confiscating electronics misbehaves doesnt shit technologically deprived proceed lie bed entire day staring ceiling contet major depressive disorder seeing therapist meds asked wants future interests wants pursue answer zest life whatsoever wasnt way avid artist pianist straight student years fallen debilitating downward spiral quit activities threatens run away home enroll school years certain caused sudden abhorrence school guessing stemmed psych ward stay april hed inpatient care week suicidal ideation results missed chunk school fell assignments hit hard decided altogether academics idea state law drop school age 18 week enrollment day board attending school

1559,"I want to die honorableI don't know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious. While I know I would never harm myself willingly, I yet desire to cease existing.   
But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle. I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave.  
And in case I don't die from that then great. But I doubt it because I am not good. I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden. And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age. So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don't regret having to go there. But yet perhaps that would make it up for this. I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway, right? So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup.   
Because else I am just a burden and non-loved by anyone. I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well. I am the kind of person that depends on others. I have to push myself and if I can't go on I just feel horrible.  
For years I have tried following my dreams, actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed. Sure I tried and did my best, there is nothing more I can do. But this is exactly what bothers me. If my best isn't enough to continue, what else can I do? You don't wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible...  
And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands. Be it job and career or love life.   
Sure I have friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food on the plate.   
But life is more than just surviving, especially in these times where society expects much more of someone.  
I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now. But the more days pass, the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die.  
Today it pushed me on the edge, I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years. To think I really be pushed that hard...  
But I don't know why for some reason I still do have hope. I kinda always have hope for something. I cannot explain this phenomenon. Even if I think I plan to die in battle, I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively. Even in such negativity, I find positivity. But this all is a double-edged sword. the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other, the side that just wants me to die.  
Does anyone else feel like this? Can you understand this?

I don't get any pleasure, motivation, or excitement from anything anymore. I used to have intense desire to draw, play video games, explore, etc. All those motivating feelings stopped as I entered my teen years (I'm now 28). I was on SSRIs as a kid and motivation wasn't an issue. It was mainly for suicidal tendencies and anxiety from my depression. However, since about 15 it's been a steep decline to Anhedonia. 

What I've done. 
I've bounced around all major SSRIs, and combined them with Wellbutrin XL to no avail. 
I've done lifestyle changes where I joined a gym and went at it 4 times a week for a year and gained 30lbs of muscle. 
I would get more sunlight.
Push myself into social gatherings with my best friends. 

Currently I'm back to 40mg prozac, but the only thing it helps is the darkened/suicidal thoughts. I just want to enjoy life again. It's been so long that I've forgotten what it's like.

tried to find work. stayed at each place for a max of three months before quitting. i could not handle any type of conflict or people treating me poorly. last july i was invited by my family to work at our family business. it’s been great for me, but mentally has been a challenge. dealing with rude customers takes a toll on my soul and my heart.

I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).

This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 

I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

So yeah, I am ashamed but this is it. Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible.

1698,"I'm done. My life cannot and will not get better. Don't give me that oh it will get better bull-crap because it won't. My reasons are simple. I have very little friends on the account that I'm homeschooled. Hell all the friends I've made thus far of backstabbed me. I met some new people recently but they live a ways away and and most of them are a couple years or more younger then me so I don't think I can make it work. Above all my biggest coping mechanism and favorite hobby video games has been striped away from me away from me by toxic fans I went in more detail on a post I  made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/m6j1rp/gamers_are_the_reason_im_depressed/). But basically I used to love the fallout series but a bunch of fanboys sucked out my joy for it. They kept hammering in my head how there opinions where superior to mine and smearing or braiding people who disagreed. I actually had an experience recently at a summer camp where someone said I had terrible taste in character and in games after voicing my opinions on the fallout series. That's actually one of the things that tipped me over the edge and made me this suicidal. Because of this toxicity and fanboyish behavior the excitement and enthusiasm I once had for games has vanished It's sad. I've said this before but I only got a chance top play four mature games on my own. I'll never get to indulge myself in the worlds of The Witcher, Bioshock, Mass-effect, The Last of Us, Half-life, many many more. I actually wanted to play the Battle for the Bikini Bottom remastered. largely because it was my dream as a kid to play it but I couldn't because it was on the game cube or something. But now I just can't these ass-wholes towaway my childhood dream. Why dose god allow this to his children. Why. Is he even real or is he just evil. I'm one of the lucky ones right now there are kids starving and here I am complaining about my trivial ass problems. I know none of you will understand my pain. You'll all laugh at me or ignore me, I understand. I'm not looking for your sympathy. I Just want people to know what I feel. I'll probably post this on another subreddit just to ensure more people see it. But I know no one will. It will get deleted of be viewed  by only a couple dozen people. I fell like the people from that one short story I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. I know that's mellow dramatic but that's how's I actually fell. Ya know I'm just rambling at this point. To be honest while this is kind of a suicide note I don't know if I can go through with it. I feel like I have nothing to live for. Yet I can never find the courage to end it all I. I don't know if any of you will take me seriously or understand where I'm coming from. But that's fine. Anyway if you've read this far down, thanks. Like I said I really don't care what Yawl  think of me. I'm just glad somebody's listening. I feel so alone in the fact that nobody really knows how I feel of listening to my problems.

I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

1765,"I'm currently pregnant with my ex boyfriend's baby. He doesn't want me to keep it but I don't feel like I can get an abortion. It's honestly tearing me apart inside because I care about my boyfriend more than I care about myself, but I also care about and feel a responsibility to protect my unborn child. I can't live with the guilt of having an abortion and I can't live with the guilt of ruining my ex partners life. The only thing I know is that I want to die. If I miscarry at some point in my pregnancy then I will kill myself. If I have the baby, I'll kill myself while the baby is being looked after by someone else. I know this sounds selfish, but it's honestly the best thing that I can do for my child, and everyone else in life. I'm such a fuck up of a person where my life has been so messed up, and I don't want my child to take after me. I just want them to be brought up by someone normal who can give them a proper chance at life. I'm not really posting this for support or reasurance, I know it's what I have to do, I just needed to get it off my chest because there's no one that I can tell.

He's at a risk of dying too because he's in the military, so I was thinking of talking to him about putting one of his family members down on our wills to be the child's parental guardian, if anyone would be willing to, should something happen to either of us.

1788,"I’ve been struggle with anxiety and depression for a long time, since before my husband and I started dating. It’s gotten significantly worse over the last 8 years, more so in the last couple of years. I’ve been working with my doctor to find a medication that will work, I’m going in between therapists. It’s debilitating. Every day is very difficult and this is the lowest I’ve been. One thing that has been crossing my mind a lot lately is wondering if my marriage is something that might be hindering my mood. We’ve been married for 8 years and together for 13. We have what I think are normal marital struggles that all couples deal with at some point. There are certain things that my husband does that really trigger my anxiety and depression and can cause me to crumple inside. I know my reaction isn’t his fault and it’s on me to manage my mood. They are things that we have talked about but we never seem to be able to change them. 

I’ve realized that stress really effects me. I can deal with my work stress but not with my personal stress. I used to think that my husband and I shared the domestic workload pretty evenly but it doesn’t feel like it. My husband will tidy the kitchen or family room when it gets out of hand but I’m realizing that if the house gets out of hand it’s because I’m not keeping up with it. The same goes for meal planning, grocery shopping, finances, caring for our child.  He’s a very attentive and loving father but he doesn’t make sure our daughter brushes and flosses, bathes, brushes her hair, go to bed on time each day - if I don’t do it then it often won’t get done. The thing is if I’m doing poorly and am in a depressed mood I’m not able to always get these things done for my daughter. Then knowing how frustrating it is for my husband makes my chest feel unbearably heavy.  Over the years it’s like these things have become solely my responsibility and hearing his frustration (lots of sighing and huffing and puffing when he cleans or gets our daughter to do something) now makes me crumple up inside and shut down. I hear it and it’s like a switch flips and I want to shut down. We’ve talked about this a couple times. How I feel like everything is weighing on me and he’ll reassure me that he doesn’t expect me to do it all… but nothing changes, if I don’t do it then it doesn’t get done and my husband is annoyed by the mess and it’s a never ending cycle. When I’m in a depressed state I have to do things in small bursts. I’ve learned that I have to stop when I feel mentally exhausted and take breaks. But the pressure that I feel (and I don’t know if it’s actually there) from my husband makes this impossible. When he’s out for the evening things feel calm and I’m able to tackle the things that need to be done but when he’s home I feel like I’m in survival mode.  Even delegating all the tasks feels like to much at this point.  

These things weigh on me so much. They eat at me every day. I keep feeling like I need to escape and that if I just had some space that my mind could rest and I could get a handle of things. 

There are other more personal marital problems that weigh on me as well and that cause the same kind of stress.

I’m starting to feel like this is a bad place for me to be as I try to get better but I don’t have a lot of trust in the way I feel about things bc I don’t know if my depression and anxiety are making me to sensitive to these things.",1,ive struggle aniety depression long time husband started dating gotten significantly worse 8 years couple years ive working doctor find medication work im going therapists debilitating day difficult lowest ive thing crossing mind lot lately wondering marriage hindering mood weve married 8 years 13 think normal marital struggles couples deal point certain things husband trigger aniety depression cause crumple inside know reaction isnt fault manage mood things talked able change ive realized stress effects deal work stress personal stress think husband shared domestic workload pretty evenly doesnt feel like husband tidy kitchen family room gets hand im realizing house gets hand im keeping goes meal planning grocery shopping finances caring child hes attentive loving father doesnt sure daughter brushes flosses bathes brushes hair bed time day dont wont thing im poorly depressed mood im able things daughter knowing frustrating husband makes chest feel unbearably heavy years like things solely responsibility hearing frustration lots sighing huffing puffing cleans gets daughter makes crumple inside shut hear like switch flips want shut weve talked couple times feel like weighing hell reassure doesnt epect changes dont doesnt husband annoyed mess ending cycle im depressed state things small bursts ive learned stop feel mentally ehausted breaks pressure feel dont know actually husband makes impossible hes evening things feel calm im able tackle things need hes home feel like im survival model delegating tasks feels like point things weigh eat day feeling like need escape space mind rest handle things personal marital problems weigh cause kind stress im starting feel like bad place try better dont lot trust way feel things dont know depression aniety making sensitive things
1789," 

So, there's the bad, the good and the ugly: Sometimes I enter in reddits like those to feel better about myself. Even more, when we are talking about relationships. I'm a 21, soon to be 22 years woman. Most of the time, I still feel like a girl. I had only two relationships on my life, one was terrible, the other was me using a person to cope with my own problems.

I see everyone having their life set. I see everyone finding someone. But I just can't. I don't find anyone to connect to, the person I like is currently dating someone else. Ar the same time, I wait for them to be over, but I feel terrible for doing it because he's my friend. At the same time, I wish that he'll be happy with her, I want him to have good memories.

I see everyone my own age going out and dating and doing stuff. I know that the reason that I don't do it, it's because of myself. I'm a person who enjoys being alone, I isolate myself and refuse to use apps like tinder, I got off of social media, because I was stalking people (something that I hate doing) and because it gave me a absurd amount of anxiety. I feel terrible because I have this urge to be with someone, but I know it's something that I want to do because it's what should be considered normal.

And I Just can't. I'm confused. I feel terrible because I feel that I have no solution.

The nice part is, at least I have my animal crossing villagers, they seem to be always happy to have me around.

(The good part of seeing everyone else having trouble and ending their relationships? It doesn't make me feel all alone. It shows that a relationship can end and that it's not all in our lives.)",1,theres bad good ugly enter reddit like feel better talking relationships im 21 soon 22 years woman time feel like girl relationships life terrible person cope problems having life set finding cant dont find connect person like currently dating ar time wait feel terrible hes friend time wish hell happy want good memories age going dating stuff know reason dont im person enjoys isolate refuse use apps like tinder got social media stalking people hate gave absurd aniety feel terrible urge know want considered normal cant im confused feel terrible feel solution nice animal crossing villagers happy good seeing having trouble ending relationships doesnt feel shows relationship end lives

I try counting the days when the thought doesn’t cross my mind, but they’re hard to find.

And it gets harder every passing night, as I’m slowly approaching the reality in which I’ll have to face my master’s course chosen from necessity, my reluctantly chosen career and my unwillingly chosen future.

A few years ago I thought that I still had some control over the path my life would take - or at least, carried a bit of positive outlook on it – but now I can’t fathom how this idea ever seemed attainable.

Dreading a possible phone call from the company I sent my application to, every night I go to sleep with an ever-growing stomach ache.

Still there is no better way.

I can’t change anything, I have to go through all of it. Two more years of university, exams, thesis writing, suffering and who knows what difficulties the work application process will encompass. Medical examinations, psychological inspection, trauma-inducing trainings, and security background check…

I am so not ready for life.

For this life.

I dwell on the happenings of the past. Look at the little girl I was just some 15 years ago, and feel my heart break.

If she hadn’t been born into an emotionally neglectful and dysfunctional environment, would she be happy now? Content with herself, understanding her ability to change her life?

Maybe she would be an artist or something else by now, in a fulfilling and healthy relationship. Loved.

If that small girl was my child, I’d raise her so much different. How could anybody have a child, just to let it be, without showing affection, parental care to them? I would give her all my love and attention that I can’t give myself.

But then again, it’s only a nice thing to say. Thinking about this won’t change a thing in my future. And even if that idyllic picture was my reality, could I be truly happy? I don’t think I’d ever be able to. 

If only suicide was a viable option.

Maybe I should really just put up with the misery I threw myself into, and bear with the life I screwed up. Play the game through, as to not transfer the pain that’s deservedly mine to take, onto another person.

I am thinking in loops again and can’t get out. Suffering of the future, suicidal ideation, family bonds, suffering of the future, suicidal ideation…

How does one live a meaningless life they don’t want, existing away, barely functioning? Some humans even seem happy here. It’s absolutely incomprehensible.

I took a resolution as a stupid kid that I won't stop till I find it no matter how many times it breaks my heart. I am not a stupid kid anymore and I've come to realise that I'm not gonna find anyone, nothing I do or change about myself matters, I'm still not gonna find love. I know I deserve to be loved and appreciated but somewhere deep in me I'm starting to feel like that's a lie I tell myself to make it feel better. It scares me to say this out loud but I don't know if I even deserve to be loved, not because I feel that way but because it's been made clear to me time and time again by people in my life. 

Sure everyone says they love me, I believe them for the most part. Yet I'm crying alone because not even the people closest to me want to help me or they're in a situation where they can't help me. I don't blame them at all, it's only fair they put themselves first. It's really hard to believe they love me when I don't feel any of it. I should just grow the fuck up and accept the fact that in probably never gonna feel loved the way I want to. Ik it's super selfish to ask that of someone but hey I guess I am selfish. 

When I was 12 I promised myself that I'd live till 21. I am now 21. I don't have any hope left. I don't know what I want. I don't know what to do. So yeah.....

1855,"I just want to vent and give some tea I guess lol. So about almost 2 months ago I left my masters program. I despised it. It made me upset. I have no passion for school. I dropped it now I'm at square one at home with my parents. And I am now pursuing my acting career that I wanted to pursue for more than a decade now. It's been going quite well to be honest. Since then I've been grinding in the hours I put into my career. Hours of practice and lots of classes. I've been struggling to find jobs though. But I am finally enjoying myself. At last.

It's been two happy months. But a few days ago my depression is creeping back. I am not medically diagnosed and I won't be because I know they'll tell me what I've known since I was 15. I don't want to go on meds. I don't want to go to therapy. I know therapy will work but to be honest I'm just too lazy to go. And the money ugh I won't be able to afford to spend like that. I don't want to burden my parents even though they'll support me 100% financially. 

I have this feeling where I just want to be alone. I don't want to communicate with anyone. I like being around people but only 1 at a time. But when I'm not interested in being around anyone I wish I could disappear from this earth or at least be the only living person on earth. I'm scared of dying but I think of suicide all the time during these phases of my depression. I would never commit it though. It would hurt my mom, dad, and brother. We're a very tight family, the 4 of us. Plus, theres too much to live for. I want to become the actor I know I can be. I want my own kid, wife, house, and just a full life. 

But these terrible thoughts just linger. Even though they do, I'm just so indifferent. It's these feelings of I don't want to feel sad, I don't want to live, I just want to be alone, I wish I could rent a cabin in the woods somewhere take one person I'm close with and sit there in silence. Look at the pretty landscapes. Enjoy life in silence. I know this state I am slowly falling into will pass me by. I'll attend my actors showcase coming up soon. I'll work. And soon enough this process will come by again to say hi. The cycle repeats itself and it'll creep up on me. But I'll keep on living.",1,want vent tea guess lola 2 months ago left masters program despised upset passion school dropped im square home parents pursuing acting career wanted pursue decade going honest ive grinding hours career hours practice lots classes ive struggling find jobs thought finally enjoying happy months days ago depression creeping medically diagnosed wont know theyll tell ive known 15 dont want meds dont want therapy know therapy work honest im lazy got money ugh wont able afford spend like dont want burden parents theyll support 100 financially feeling want dont want communicate like people 1 time im interested wish disappear earth living person earth im scared dying think suicide time phases depression commit thought hurt mom dad brother tight family 4 plus theres live want actor know want kids wife house life terrible thoughts linger im indifferent feelings dont want feel sad dont want live want wish rent cabin woods person im close sit silence look pretty landscapes enjoy life silence know state slowly falling pass ill attend actors showcase coming soon ill work soon process come cycle repeats itll creep ill living

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks ""Are you O.K?"", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say ""Of course Mom!"", and move on with my life.

Maybe I'm ugly, maybe he's just turned off by me, maybe maybe maybe. He would always say he didnt know why he just wouldnt make a move. I was always the one to do it first. 

Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 

Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.

So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

But I just feel so empty. I keep picturing myself slitting my wrist in the tub like a bad movie, or just overdosing on pills. I keep seeing myself running into traffic or driving off the side of the road. Maybe I dont have the guts idk. I just want this to be over. This pain isnt fun. Trying to catch my breath.

I dont want this. I want help to fix my brain. I hate myself for it. I hate him for not accepting me. I hate the world that lables mental illness. I hate this life.

In the run up to this episode:
-I lost confidence in my psych after he tried to charge me a $50 fee to send records for a second opinion
-I discovered sexual abuse in my family that had been covered up by the victims’ parents, after already having a feeling that something of that nature may have happened to me.
-I nearly survived a severe car crash (head on collision missed by a hair) when another driver was going full speed down the wrong lane. I was the driver.
-My partner told me I have disappointed him by failing to make time to spend just with him

1880,"It's just one more monthHey,

Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.

To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.

Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.

After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.

After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.

In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.

I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

I don't know how to keep climbing out of this ever deepening hole.",1,monthhey planning post r depression felt appropriate sum im transgender 20 years old etremely severe depression treatment went antidepressants month ago effects asked doctors office emergency appointment havent heard things worse today got bed went straight bath fell asleep hours later got went bed slept mother got home walked dogs asked lunch considered lying didnt energy told piece old stale bread lunch truth got angry wasnt eating properly upset sad angry got angry didnt dishwasher came room told wasnt cooking dinner stayed bed couldnt bring respond laid shes currently eating dinner im room month meet trans care people time tell theyve decided treat probably thought 2 years havent moved step direction know probably feel better actually managed doctor med know probably wouldnt spending entire day sleeping andlor thinking ending cant bring thought cant pick phone cant eat dont know climbing deepening hole

I remember one day someone said to me “you look happier lately” and that was a good summer I was about to turn 18, and life was looking like it would start being better. Then my mom died 3 days before my birthday and I found her. Instead of acting like a total wreck, it was more of a shock and I was extremely numb and closed off after that for a long time. It’s been 3 years this month and just this past week I finally came to terms and realized just how hurt and deeply embedded in my depression I’ve been. Having a job, car, place of my own, it was like a front and something that convinced me and others that I’ve been fine. But I’m so not. Depression has taken my energy, creativity, personality, I’m so antisocial it’s just anxiety and fear to be around people sometimes. My boyfriend has been wanting to break up and told me this morning he made out with some random at a bar last weekend while wasted and that he had sex with 2 different people in the last couple years.

1951,"Hi,

I've been a bit lost in life I admit since graduating college almost 5 years ago, but a few years ago I realized what used to be fun no longer is. I used to play video games with my friends and still do but feel no joy, I only do it to be able to speak with them. I started baking but I realize I do it to get my mind off things it's not fun it's an accomplishment possibly. 

I started Therapy January 2020 and brought this up with my Therapist that I can't find anything that is fun a few months ago but they didn't say much to my statements and we moved on. I do have anxiety however, right now it's actually much lower than it's ever been. Before they left for vacation almost a month ago they said I have the positive and negative of too much time as I work part time. 

I'm really lost in life right now and was working with a Career Coach and one of the final questions was again something similar if money, expenses didn't matter what would I do for fun. I sat for hours until 2 am thinking and couldn't come up with anything.

The world in general I realize I feel a bit lost, each suburb seems the same and the city raises my anxiety. I don't know where I belong or what to do. There's just wondering what to do and no time for fun or I can't figure out what is/ would be fun. Long walks are relaxing but not fun.

Is this maybe just a phase while I try to get a sense of direction in life? Then things will start showing up that seem fun? If everyday feels the same and the days blend into each other how do you take time off for fun?",1,ive bit lost life admit graduating college 5 years ago years ago realized fun longer play video games friends feel joy able speak started baking realize mind things fun accomplishment possibly started therapy january 2020 brought therapist cant find fun months ago didnt statements moved aniety right actually lower left vacation month ago said positive negative time work time im lost life right working career coach final questions similar money epenses didnt matter fun sat hours 2 thinking couldnt come world general realize feel bit lost suburb city raises aniety dont know belong theres wondering time fun cant figure fun long walks relaing fun maybe phase try sense direction life things start showing fun everyday feels days blend time fun

I know I did terribly on it even though I studied quite a bit, and I also feel worse and blame myself more because I know I could've done more to study but I've felt incredibly drained and depressed lately and struggle focusing on my work. I can't stop blaming myself because I know I could do better, and I just feel really stupid and worthless. I can't tell my parents about any of it because they wouldn't understand that I'm struggling and just say I'm being lazy or not trying or don't care. They're very strict and only seem to focus on school. I took the school year online, and I have no idea how to succeed in online classes. I hate isolation and online school because I just feel lonely all the time, and I don't really have any friends I can talk to. I got a scholarship for a good college because I had strong grades in highschool, but now I'm at significant risk to lose it due to my grades dropping since I have to keep above a certain gpa to maintain it.

1959,"It feels like it's creeping up on me, not sure how much longer I can go on with it.It's been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of 51. I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.

It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.

I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.

I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love.",1,feels like creeping sure longer ifits eactly month mother died age 51 considered worry scenario 30s dealing age 19 ive criticized pointed im coping happening deep inside im hurt like rest im desensitized quarrels problems depression leading mention nightmares single night mother brother living father left relationship dispute time ago younger happened felt like control situation doesnt want support brother financially hes job right cant support socially lives city hes tell job start manning responsibilities mother care fair brother willpower want grievance counselor brother procrastination depression aniety getting better doubt father willing help regard feel broken right unable work todays society everyones pushing forward telling need feel matter time brother hatches idea plays like sort dramatic movie asked brother today feeling today scale 0 like day 10 knows today replied replied thats probably desensitization talking im probably closer 8 9 feel like revolving money doesnt feel right especially considering mother paid spousal support shed spend money brother goes dad havent seen ive tried speaking dad hold little supports right heads asks want support dont know anymore dont know live definitely dont know help lot things asked mother hold hand help support able tough love

1961,"I'm sorry. I just need to vent.

Wake up every day wishing I didn't. Almost 30 with a job I hate that pays barely above minimum wage, no partner and no relationship experience, and pretty much am an unskilled laborer. The happiest time in my life was working in retail as a merchandiser, but this messed up world prevents you from being able to pay the bills with that type of job.

I hate myself and feel numb. I fake a smile and laugh around people. I overeat because I'm miserable, and I'm miserable because I overeat. I fluctuate between being underweight and a normal weight multiple times a month. All I do is sleep, wake up, go to work, put on a mask, return ""home,"" binge to the point of physcial pain, regret it then punish myself by not eating, cry myself to sleep--repeat.

I'm too scared to end myself. I wish someone would just hit me through the skull with a stray bullet or run up behind me with a knife. I wish I could just go to bed one day and not wake up. COVID has only made me crawl deeper into my dark hole. I'm a horrible person who caught myself being jealous of people who caught COVID and died.

I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of trying so hard for the next year to just be even shittier. I've been bullied and abused all my life. Even if someone did show an interest in me, I am too broken and don't know how to be a partner. I hate it here. I cry every single day when nobody is looking. I hate being alive.

1963,"My boyfriend (M19) orders food for me because I am unable to prepare food myself.

I (F19) am in a long distance relationship. We've known each other for over a year now, we've never met in person, but we facetime every day and talk for hours. He knows that my mental state is not so good. I didn't share much about it in the beginning. He only knew that my sleep schedule was very bad (I went to bed at 11:00 am). Another problem is that I am very bad at eating regularly because I have no energy to cook and there is little food in the house. I can't go to the grocery store myself and am dependent on the food in the house. I hardly have any appetite.

My bf is very  worried about this. because I am so often tired and because 500 kcal a day is simply not healthy. He has known my address for several months and he first sent me presents, letters, etc. But because I eat less and less, he wanted to order food for me for a long time. He wants to order me snacks that are easy to eat (I can't cook… nope not even milkshakes, I live off slices of bread and granola bars). Normally dinner is my only meal of the day, but because I'm skipping it more and more now, he has ordered me fast food quite often. (10 times in 2 months..) I feel very guilty about that, but I know the calories are welcome.

 His problem is that he can't physically make me food and he does know himself that it's expensive and not healthy... if I just say I'm having a bad eating day, he'll order it for me. My parents say they are ashamed and that I make my bf feel like there would be no food in the house. And I'm about to tell my boyfriend I want him to stop ordering food. Because I don't think I'm worth all that money and food. However, my bf keeps insisting that I have to keep eating and that he will continue to order food for me at all costs, especially if I'm having a really bad calorie day….

1985,"No one should ever have to go through what I have gone through. God— and I know that there are people out there that have it infinitely worse than I have. I'm graduating high school with people that have so much to show for what they’ve worked for. This award, that medal, this scholarship, valedictorian, 4.0, acceptance to Yale, UPenn, Vanderbilt, etc etc. I studied and worked my ass off in high school. I pushed and pushed until I thought I couldn’t make it. Things fell apart, and I fell into survival mode; I just needed to make it through alive. Every day became a struggle. One day I was anxiety-ridden, irritable, mad, self-loathing. The next I was depressed with no motivation to walk from class to class. The day after, I felt nothing. Emptiness. Numbness. Dissociation. I genuinely don’t know how I made it. It’s not that I wanted to kill myself… I just didn’t want to be alive anymore.

I’ve graduated now, and I’m headed off to college in a few weeks. But, I have nothing to show for the past 4 Years I’ve endured. Not much compared to all the other people that were able to keep their head on their shoulders through high school and get into phenomenal colleges. They’re going to make it through— land those internships, graduate top of their class, do well financially for their future families. My future is a question mark. My past is questionable. I don’t feel present either.

Unlike an award or a scholarship, I have nothing to show for what I’ve fought for these past few years. No one knows except me and God. And I don’t know how to feel about that. The product of my success is that I am still standing here… more or less in one piece. I’ve been broken numerous times, but I'm still standing. And you would never know from my resume. 

It breaks my heart that people are going through it right now— it breaks my heart that someone is going through what I have, and God forbid, something worse. I want to help those people with all of my heart. I want them to understand that fighting to survive does not mean that you are weak or a failure. It means that you are strong. If you are going through something like this, I want you to know that I love you deeply, and I feel for you, even though I may not know you.

2022,"Seriously. How? 

I have struggled with rapid cycling bipolar 1 (among other disorders) for years and I'm just so tired. Like exhausted. Nothing feels fun anymore. I can't find enjoyment in anything that I used to. This happens all the time but this time feels different. I don't know..this time is way harder. It's like I feel doomed. I can't sleep because I lay in bed with paranoid panic about everything I might have done wrong to ruin my future life. I can't afford health insurance to get back to treatment/therapy (which I need and miss very much). 

I have been struggling for so long with no one to talk to that I put in years of being the ""good advice friend""..helping others through hard times in hopes that any of them would come to care about me enough to be there for me too. Instead I became to person people only come to when they need help. They dump their feelings and problems onto me to use me for advice, then disappear once they feel better. If I mentioned a was struggling there was AT BEST maybe a ""that sucks, I'm sorry"" but usually radio silence. If I didn't message first I didn't hear from them unless they needed something...and eventually I just stopped responding. I've come to realize I really truly have no friends.

The only people I have left are my family and my partner. I love my family so much but I can't talk to them because I'm not comfortable with it. I don't want to seem like I'm after attention.. the problem I that with no one to talk to, I end up boiling over and having extreme meltdowns at home. Leaving my partner being the only one who knows how bad I am truly struggling. How bad I am really doing. The littlest inconvenience or problem and I explode into these uncontrollable angry/upset crying episodes in which I vent every single thing that I'm upset about and I'm nearly inconsolable. The problem is, with my bipolar episodes, it's like an out of body experience. Like I'm floating above this out of control version of myself and I know I need to calm down. I know I am out of control and I need to breathe, but I can't do anything about it. I fear I'm ruining their life by being in it. Sometimes I think about how much easier it would be for everyone if I were gone. That their lives would be better. I know that's wrong in a sense though. I know it would hurt them if I killed myself. I know they would struggle and I dont want the for them. But I'm so tired. I'm tired of being sad. 

I'm tired of everything. 

Sometimes I think about how hard life is with mental illness and I can't imagine what it would be like to be someone who is just mentally healthy.

I want to have fun and be happy. I just don't know how anymore. It feels so out of reach.

Anyone have any advice?",1,seriously struggled rapid cycling bipolar 1 disorders years im tired like ehausted feels fun anymore cant find enjoyment happens time time feels different dont knowthis time way harder like feel doomed cant sleep lay bed paranoid panic wrong ruin future life cant afford health insurance treatment therapy need miss struggling long talk years good advice friendhelping hard times hopes come care instead person people come need help dump feelings problems use advice disappear feel better mentioned struggling best maybe sucks im sorry usually radio silence didnt message didnt hear needed somethingand eventually stopped responding ive come realize truly friends people left family partner love family cant talk im comfortable dont want like im attention problem talk end boiling having etreme meltdowns home leaving partner knows bad truly struggling bad littlest inconvenience problem eplode uncontrollable angry upset crying episodes vent single thing im upset im nearly inconsolable problem bipolar episodes like body eperience like im floating control version know need calm know control need breathe cant fear im ruining life think easier gone lives better know thats wrong sense thought know hurt killed know struggle dont want im tired im tired sad im tired think hard life mental illness cant imagine like mentally healthy want fun happy dont know anymore feels reach advice

2025,"I wrote this letter to a general audience as I’m currently in the midst of the worst part of one of my depressive swings. I wrote it knowing one day this will be true, that I will get to the other side. I read it when I’m feeling my worst, sometimes 5x in an hour. I hope it helps someone as much as it is helping me. 

“Depression: it’s an ugly disorder that is unyielding and unkind. I’m a long-time sufferer of anxiety and depression. While I’m normally able to keep depression at bay most days, a recent breakup triggered in me many insecurities and wounds that sent me spiraling to that dark place and left me feeling alone and helpless. Only recently did I get to the other side. I want everyone to know it’s ok to not be ok. Use your network: reach out to friends, call a hotline, journal, get a therapist, just don’t do it alone. Keep doing the small things: shower, brush your teeth, comb your hair, even if that’s all you can muster all day. Take care of yourself: eat what you can when you can, watch movies, cry it out, take a sick day, fill your calendar with things to look forward to or people that will make you get out of bed. Depression can lie and say we’re in it by ourselves, but nothing is further from the truth. While social media can be deceiving and convince us everyone else around us is happy and has the perfect life, we have to remember that it is a heavily filtered version of reality. No one posts pictures of the days they can’t get out of bed. No one posts about the nights they cry themselves to sleep on the bathroom floor. No one writes about the immense loneliness, emptiness, and numbness they battle with on a daily basis. But if I’ve learned anything in life, it’s that everything changes, nothing is permanent, for good or bad. This too shall pass. There is hope on the other side; get help, just don’t give up.”",1,wrote letter general audience im currently midst worst depressive swings wrote knowing day true read im feeling worst e hours hope helps helping depression ugly disorder unyielding unkind im longtime sufferer aniety depression im normally able depression bay days recent breakup triggered insecurities wounds sent spiraling dark place left feeling helpless recently want know ok ok use network reach friends hotline journal therapist dont small things shower brush teeth comb hair thats muster day care eat watch movies cry sick day fill calendar things look forward people bed depression lie truth social media deceiving convince happy perfect life remember heavily filtered version reality posts pictures days cant bed posts nights cry sleep bathroom floor writes immense loneliness emptiness numbness battle daily basis ive learned life changes permanent good bad shall pass hope help dont

2068,"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don’t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

Goodbye,

I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.   
I hate every moment. The only reason why I am living is my family and brother. I do not want them to feel sad when I die.

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",0,posting galadriels opening monologue day girlfriend day 3 galadriel speaking partly elvish amar prestar aenai world changed math ne nen feel water mathon ned cae feel earth han noston ned gwilith smell air lost live remember began forging great rings given elves immortal wisest fairest beings seven dwarflords great miners craftsmen mountain halls rings gifted race men desire power rings bound strength govern race deceived ring deep land mordor fires mount doom dark lord sauron forged master ring ring poured cruelty malice dominate life ring rule free lands middleearth fell power ring resisted alliance men elves marched armies mordor slopes mount doom fought freedom middleearth victory near power ring undone moment hope faded isildurs son king took fathers sword sauron enemy free peoples middleearth defeated ring passed isildurs chance destroy evil forever hearts men easily corrupted ring power betrayed isildurs death things forgotten lost history legend legend myth half thousand years ring passed knowledge chance came ensnared bearer came creature gollum took deep tunnels misty mountains consumed ring gave gollum unnatural long life years poisoned mind gloom gollum cave waited darkness crept forests world rumor grew shadow east whispers nameless fear ring power perceived time come abandoned gollum happened ring intend picked unlikely creature imaginable hobbits bilbo baggins shire time soon come hobbits shape fortunes

EDIT: When I say no boundaries I mean that there a no limits to the things you can do when you realize people don't care unless it affects them directly.

 my brother and uncle are severely autistic and house bound (neither of them have left the house since they were about 3 and 5) and my brother is mute. Both older than me by 2 years and 3 years.

 I'm the only one in the family my mum has that will support and look after them now until I or them die. I know it may be selfish but sometimes I wish they were normal, i have never and will never have a normal life I've never had the fun teenage years that most do, and now for the rest of my life I have to make sure its perfect to care for these two, I can never relax and everything I always wanted to do like go to college and become something, isn't possible.

I feel like I just mess up everything, I have NO friends, not a single one, my family live 2 hours away from me, i tried so hard with my job, I worked double shifts without getting payed, I worked from 7am until 12am at night and had to walk 30mins + home and I never complained, and then they fired me because I didn't answer my phone for one day because I was with my nan on my day off.  Nothing ever fucking works out. 

I don't know how to fix things, I've started drinking cause why not? Life's a mess anyway and I have nothing else to help me with it all. I've already had an eviction notice cause I can't pay my rent, I just fuckinf give up.

2105,"Typing something out before I sleepMan, the day was stressful. I really find myself scared of what I do feeling that. I can take a shower and feel flabbergasted that such actions could've existed.

I don't know what happens when people get older. They join causes. They become activists. They become conspiracy theorists. It happens to ALL OF THEM! They all think they're living works of fiction. Listen to them TALK! It's not that fiction imitates reality. It's that people imitate fiction. Maybe, though, you'll ask them ""what's realistic about movies"" and they'll say ""NOTHING!"" Okay, so why are they all afraid that ""reality is movies?""

How is Rugrats ""worse for kids"" than an R-rated movie or a porno? Hell if I know. The topless beach I was once taken to remains my worst enemy. Just a few hours there twenty years ago and what are people MOST hyperbolic about? Sex. Can't they talk normally? Each time I'm asked about ""topless beaches,"" I know what to expect. They sure have it wrong when I don't want to deal with their obsessions over ""lady nipples not being acceptable in this nation.""

When people get older, at least here, they start to complain about this nation. They cry about ""the better cultures."" I sure HAVE been told ""I've been sympathetic toward the enemy"" for saying that ""I don't care."" 

They have existential crises about whatever corporations get to be trendy. Apparently, they lose their childhood happiness.

I wasn't the kind of kid who was going to discover PBS on my own. Turned out that when kids got older and ""PBS was for babies,"" I couldn't recite jack shit from those shows. Being a toddler, I had hated people associating me with those shows.

People my age are fixated on nostalgia. I don't feel any nostalgia. When people got older and they had gained political views, I couldn't take part in that. Of course, I couldn't. When I had been a child, some things were far better than cartoons had been. It didn't mean they were good, but that didn't stop people from referring to me as a boy genius.

On top of all this, I have family that doesn't treat me well.

Each day, I put on the act and I'm sure visibly distressed. I don't want to deal with each day. Everything is nothing. Nothing is anything. That's not philosophy.

This gives me an inability to truly feel hatred or to understand everyone having ""morality"" fits. I'm always observing this humanity zoo.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide.",1,sorry 12 9 19 953 1028 18+ mentions ahead decade comes end realize life messed bad im strong small kill point time read youll know start let im struggling gender identity im typing lets im young nonbinary born female born multiple sicknesses visible im sure eactly distinct scar lower stomach ages 14 lived grandmother mom dad uncle uncle severely depressed started abusing drugs point dont remember time life happy video movie life alot violence remember film mother chased man gun ive fear mother killed ages 59 moved new house parents visited grandmother frequently house kind like safe place age 6 man chased mother gun film friend came house drunk assaulted parents pistol bat cant remember step brother seually assaulted multiple times grandmother sell house uncle attempted kill oding drugs bathtub guy age time touched places wished didnt ages 1011 started feeling depressed thought self harm came parents panseual having breakdown started having frequent visits school counselor guy age kept calling things like se toy slut hed tell dream guys age 12 started cutting lying parents getting toic relationships manipulated relationship girl didnt like sent therapy drove hiked eff tornado best friends passed away stepbrother kicked house ive seen boyfriend person trusted time ghosted cheated friend calls night saying shes going hurt kill committed suicide

2127,"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.",1,came backi m 12 live christian neighborhood attempted suicide 2017 obviously failed started seeking help keeping secret including parents recovered midland spring 2018 accidentally told people attempted suicide luckily think joke reason depression actually diagnosed symptoms abuse yelled beaten kindergarten 5 years old humiliated bullied looks overweight start primary school increasing pressure fulfill high epectations straight told abuse normal recovery making efforts slimmer stopped parents saying cant diet young instead diet started eating healthier dad stopped beating knew getting stronger working fight emotional manipulation verbal abuse stop start august staying aunts uncles house week week great epectations kept working kept stable weight cat way lonely inside time came home second day dad came tried kiss arm got way immediately started yelling saying respect know love love ungrateful yelled away rights including free speech tried cut yell answer said hated relaed started yelling similar case happened weeks ago went walk started yelling food want said similar case described ecept mental breakdown punched gave promise angry knew bullshit ecept screw day yelled cry fill 100 male tears mugs broke promise net day acted happened thing got right night love realized love 2 years ago laws country murdered defend emotionally overwhelmed imagined killing day suicidal thoughts came slowly emotional support dont know tell ecept

2138,"Bye To Anyone That Even Cares To Take Their Time And Read ThisI know this seems cliché, but I honestly feel better off dead. I realize I'm not the only one who has had a shitty life, but it's about time I think about what I want. I can't even describe, or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I've had to put up in the past and my current status is no better. Maybe not as violent? But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread. I had a dream before making this thread. I would like to share with each individual's undivided attention. As I said before I've been through a lot of trauma. I have been through heart aches, violence, plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it's part. I even was one of those victims or could've been after attempting my very 1st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for 5 minutes and that's being aided by medical personnel. I'm no war veteran or anything. I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it's like playing chess except I was the pawn, but that's just it? I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind? I was doing this all myself. I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say ""I love you and everything will be alright"". I don't have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I'm worthy enough of their time and never take me serious. Anyways sorry for going off topic, but this dream I had was a beautiful thing. At least in my eyes. That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me. Keep in mind I am not terminally ill, nor am I mocking those that are. In fact if you want my opinion? I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don't deserve to lose their lives. I know what to expect now. Someone will say "" well neither do you"" or ""what makes you so different from the rest of us""? Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else's so of course I'm going to feel like I'm the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don't and with the most pain. Life will be better without me and some will not understand me? And some might and even if you do show care? It's not genuine. Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole. I know some will say "" we can't stop you "" nor do I expect anyone to, but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this? I'll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now. Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace.

Things I used to enjoy, I can't stand to do them for longer than 30 minutes anymore.

I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember. This just feels different though. I want it all to stop. I would turn to drugs and alcohol, but I can't even afford those. They only thing keeping me here is my family and girlfriend. If I were to do it, I can't stand to think the hurt they would go through. 

I just don't want to deal with the stress anymore. I want to sit down and not worry about something for one damn minute. I have no sexual urges anymore as a result of anxiety and depression.

2226,"Waking up in the middle of the night, weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay alive.It's currently Monday morning, 3:30AM, I woke up about two hours ago, still half drunk, having had about 3 hours sleep, ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed. I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  


My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I kind of just wish I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night, I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing. Love (of any kind) seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment. Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me, left or died? I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now.

2261,"Hey, Lar...[home](http://i.imgur.com/8nD5j.jpg)

Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe. Yeah, I get it: your own parent not wanting you. After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. 

She left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they'd take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.

Did you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he'd kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was ""completely satisfied"". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She's a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.

Know how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. 
Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I'd never been born, screaming, ""Are you fucking retarded?!"" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn't even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told ""No one likes you!"" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you're unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.
Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she's from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they're tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn't even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I'd pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I'd only wanted to be accepted. It didn't help that her next ""husband"" tried to convince me I'm crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn't talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I'd call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she'd do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He'd told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn't walked in the room. He'd sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he'd had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn't like someone, his first comment was that ""there was something wrong with them in the head"". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There's can't really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn't I? Please tell me I'm not crazy...it's eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I'm not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I'd rather have O'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so ""nice""...good old ""uncle rick"". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.
Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I've tried to be strong.  The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You'd be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you'd have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you'd ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you'd be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I've been so isolated for most of my life. O'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We're stuck in poverty...there's no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I'm stupid, I'm crazy, and I'm unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for ""other people"". 

From what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she'd be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They're better off without me, I'm so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They'd be better off with her. They're the only things I love in this world, but I'm no good for them. Daddy, please...I'm so fucking scared...I'm so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I've tried to get education and make things better...I've tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to  you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I've given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can't go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I'd spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can't do this anymore, however.

2307,"I just need someone to listen to me...Back story: I'm 18, I've been suffering from depression for 3 or 4 years but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I'm scared that they won't take me seriously and think I'm just another teenager. I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. 

Now to my current problems:

I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. 
When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.
At this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.

I'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.

I'm also poor as fuck. My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work. My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills. I've been trying to find a job but somehow, the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me. All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old. 

I'm sorry about this rant and I thank you for reading it. It took me 3 hours and 20 cigarettes to finally get written out.",1,need listen meback story im 18 ive suffering depression 3 4 years dont want doctor im scared wont seriously think im teenagers talked problems try freeze unable past couple years tried kill 20 times including pills alcohol trying drown current problems came gay finished elses 16 friends said didnt care 2 months 2 3 friends talk went school pick gise certificates 100 people old friends classmates included started shouting insults like faggot queer right 5 minutes road couldnt hear best friend time stopped talking 2 3 months incident friend time talked right october 2011 stopped talking started drugs sorts went new school year start levels new friends come smoke weed month ago eact thing good friends stopped talking need usually ask cigarette time month friends baby understand baby stopped talking theyve time child going nearly day time friends talk person ive talked today mom 3 words im love straight guy school talk feel im scared happen year group school consisting 25 people good friends plus way consists finding fun taking piss long time year group school hear day wont able stay year people day cant school able previously electrician training course im poor fuck mom lot health problems unable work dad works job earns cover bills ive trying find job people qualifications picked jobs instead clothes borderline small year old im sorry rant thank reading took 3 hours 20 cigarettes finally written

2351,"I'm a almost 17 year old and I am just confused. With everything. I feel lost and with no path. I'm constantly home not just from the quarantine but also tbh I don't have many friends. Or at least good ones most are just rude and before this I just asked if anyone would be willing to do something and was just ignored. I got good family members. But they're just constantly saying how smart I am and I just worry I'm gonna screw up. Like this is real dumb but I watched stranger things and just thought how I don't have friends like that I have no cool memories in my childhood I've just always existed. Quarantine took my last Halloween. A year of my ending childhood. I feel lonely to the point I can't sleep. I try to be nice but for some reason everyone finds it fun to make fun of me. It's a running joke how everyone wants to make fun of me. How I'm a nerd and play dnd and video games. Im kinda antisocial but like not to fault I just have issues getting started with someone like getting to know them. I honestly had a bunch of thoughts but typing this I don't know what to say. I just kinda want a purpose. One thing I've always been ashamed of thinking is why do people stay alive in terrible situations. I mean like zombies. What's the joy in your life. It makes me worry if I'd be willing of I came to something like that. I feel trapped. Where I live nothing great exists. It's boring and nothing enjoyable is around here. So again I'm left sitting in the house. Again I had watched stranger things and it left me with this ""nostalgia"". It became popular in a great point in my life. I had met this girl and I liked her (I don't want to say love but idk) a lot. But that wasn't all. Her group and my group hanged out all the time and I felt like I belonged for once.

2417,"First time ever writing my feelings down so please bare with me, I hope it makes sense! I don't even know where to start but I will try.

Since I was a teenager I felt different. I was very quiet and had low confidence. I had plenty of friends but always felt like the odd one out, I drank alcohol (alot) to mask my sadness. When I was 20, my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me. It was really hard (my first heartbreak) but what I wasn't prepared for was when he left me so did most of my friends. You see he was a popular guy and girls wanted to be around him. I was too quiet and embarrassed to say anything, it made me feel worthless. It didn't seem to matter that these people had been my friends for 10 years! I became more isolated, I still had a couple of friends but never felt good enough. I increased my drinking to make me feel better. Started seeing guy after guy, not always sexual but there are a few regrets I won't lie. In the meantime I couldn't hold a job, I never felt good enough and I felt it got in the way of my drinking. I didn't go to college because I thought I wasn't smart enough. I was arguing with my parents alot because of my excessive drinking. I was extremely depressed but told nobody.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 25 I was still the same, going nowhere in life.. gaining weight, can't drive, can't hold a job, no college education, still drinking, still living with my parents. All because I felt I was not good enough for this world. I was in the absolute pits of hell it felt like. Fighting every single day against a demon inside my head telling me all of these negative things about myself. One day I eventually broke down and told my parents how I was actually feeling and why I was like this. They were shocked (I covered my sadness well) I could actually feel the weight had been lifted. I went to the doctor, started medication and counselling.  All was going quite well I felt I was getting stronger. I started a job in an office in a school. That is where I met my boyfriend (he is a teacher).

&#x200B;

I was on cloud nine. I knew from the first few dates that he was my soulmate and I would be with him forever. I could gush about what a wonderful person he is but I will spare ye!! Over the next few years I was happier than ever loving my life with him. I was working in a new job, did a college course, I was still drinking but not as much.

&#x200B;

But it was too good to be true. The inner voice came back telling me I wasn't good enough. My parents and boyfriend would be better off without me. I was very suicidal and wrote my letters explaining my decision to them. Thankfully I broke down one night and told my boyfriend and with my parents help they all rallied around and tried to get me better again. It has been working on and off.

&#x200B;

I hate myself right now. I feel like I am going backwards.

If I write it all down I am a very lucky person on paper:

&#x200B;

My boyfriend proposed 5 weeks ago. We are getting married in 2023.

We are in the middle of building our forever home. We hope to be moved in next year!

My parents are very supportive of me and allowing me and boyfriend to live with them while we save money for our house.

I have 3 best friends who never left my side through all my depression and drinking.

I have a good job in a hospital.

I have just finished a course in Mental Health and would love to pursue counselling in young people.

I did a charity skydive this year and raised money for a mental health charity.

I gave up drinking one year ago and it improved my life and relationships with everyone drastically.

I still don't drive but I know I need to soon as my new home will be in the countryside! (driving gives me huge anxiety, I feel sick just typing about it)

&#x200B;

I have come such a long way!! I am 30 now. Yet here I am at 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon lying in bed (when I should be at work) crying my eyes out because I think everyone deserves better than me. I feel like I am not good enough and I want to die! whhhyyyyy does this never go away!!

About 5 months ago i threw a party the day covid limits were lifted there was a girl there with whom i was friends with that slept at my house after the party ended, everything right for the night and the morning after i asked her if she wanted to fuck and she accepted.

One week later some friends of both asked me what happened and when i told them what whappened told me that she was accusing me of raping her, i was fucking devastastated by that but at least i was Happy that my Friends has asked me what happened and seemed to believe me

One month afterwards all the friends that had told me that were saying that i had raped her, two months after and not only that but she also proceded to report me to the police for rape, three months from that and not only the Friends we have in common but also my Friends from college stoped talking to me

One month ago i finally had a good new because the case was dropped because she failed to present any proof of the acusation and i presented an audio where she did recognise that she had consented to fuck with me
I thought that the case being dropped would finally end with all of this and for a time It was but today the last friend from college Who already new all that happened has stopped talking to me 

She hasnt answered any of my messages for more tjam a week and she has thrown me out from her followers on insta, i know it might not seem like much but i know the meaning of this kind of acts 

I just dont know what to do with my life right now
I have tried to be a good person for all my life and a good friend so i dont know what the fuck this has to happen to me, i really thought that the case being dropped would show to people that i hadnt done anything wrong but not only that but i am also still losing people.
Is this all that Will be left for me? Losing people little by little for something that i didnt do? Getting torn apart just because someone said that i did something even when i proved i didnt do It?

2494,"I'm not suicidal, but I need some help and advice...I really hate living at home with my parents. I'm 21 and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love, but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country... the market is empty. I apply for ANY job and I mean anything, retail, cleaning and janitorial, sales and marketing. Shit I don't even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i'm trying as hard as I can. I'm also told that I can't have an opinion on anything, I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this, verbatim from them ""You can't have an opinion on this subject""... i'm told that I can't give them suggestions because I don't have a family.

i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can't leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack, here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread.
&gt;About 4 years ago, A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop, We would have been about 16 at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised... It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me, Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on. I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher, called my parents to come pick me up.
I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person... Myself and his brother(who was in my year) both have hated each other for about 2-3 years before all this happened. One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives, so we went to his house and got the phone back. I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father, because of that and now his brother blames me for it.
Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house. I can't catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me. We don't live far apart (2 stops) so I get worried that he might get off and hit me. Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because ""He probably doesn't care about you anymore"" and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me. So instead of catching the bus straight home (it's not walking distance), I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre, but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them. I have told them why I do it, but again they shrug it off.
It's not like I'm depressed though, I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don't want to be put in a situation where my life could end, I'm actually a generally happy person... I have some really good friends(Who I haven't told about this because we really don't talk about problems) and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course. I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no-one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don't care. I don't want to talk it through with him because I don't want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me.

So I want to move out but I don't want to live with other people I don't trust. I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won't be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I don't ever swear around my parents, EVER. I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel. So that is how serious I feel.

I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist, but it's WAY too expensive and my parents won't help me with the money because they don't give a shit anyway.   

I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I love life most times. Just when i'm home life drags me down when I'm reminded that i'm useless for wasting my life so far.",1,im suicidal need help advicei hate living home parents im 21 job convinced parents qualified industry love left qualified apply tech industry small country market apply job mean retail cleaning janitorial sales marketing shit dont know thing want job stop rubbing face making butt jokes im trying hard im told cant opinion tell save money shopping store called andi apposed woolworths literally told verbatim cant opinion subject im told cant suggestions dont family problems accepting phobia cant leave house having mini panic attack story happened pasted thread gt 4 years ago friend walking home coffee shop 16 time spotted recognised person having dramas school running tilt luckily walking past school time open play putting ran fast school got teacher called parents come pick eplain having dramas particular person brother years hated 23 years happened day stole phone knew lives went house got phone later learned mother sent live state father brother blames brother hated bad aniety time leave house cant catch bus home rides bus gets dont live far apart stops worried hit talk parents tell probably doesnt care anymore pussy faggot live recent spat punch deaths makes scared position life end punch frightens hell instead catching bus straight home walking distance movies parents pick theatre stopped minor inconvenience told shrug like im depressed thought life fear actually dont want situation life end im actually generally happy person good friends havent told dont talk problems new ones course aniety runs family understands feel caused thoughts like frankly dont care dont want talk dont want run risk reminding case forget want dont want live people dont trust live centerline welfare payments find job wont decent living home especially living sydney epensive cities world dont swear parents feel disrespectful swear people driven today tell mum fuck multiple times today feel feel asked aniety stuff referred psychologist way epensive parents wont help money dont shit guess want advice current situation want reiterate dont suicidal thoughts love life times im home life drags im reminded im useless wasting life far

2515,"Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven’t made a post like this before, but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such. Right now, I’m not doing well and I’m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won’t scare and worry my friends and family.

I’ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isn’t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.

My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day.  (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I don’t have many friends left around me. 

The night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn’t say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They don’t understand it, and Don’t believe I am and think I’m chasing something that doesn’t exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasn’t able to.

I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I don’t think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). 

All this is too much for me right now; with the added fact I’ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don’t find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that it’s a problem I need to work on.

I’ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I don’t know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didn’t need. 

I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain I’m feeling and put it on to them. I’m just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don’t want to burden them. I’m just so afraid, and lonely right now. I don’t want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable. I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away.

2518,"

I’ve been doing really well mentally so I decided I should try dating again. I had the best date of my whole life with such a sweet and beatiful girl and I can’t help but feel that I fucked it up. We were getting along so well, she was so affectionate in the first half and I felt cared for in a way I haven’t felt in a really long time. Unfortunately we got on a touchy subject which I thought would be alright but it ended up being what I think to be a sore spot for her. After that she seemed a lot less affectionate and was more closed off. She still seemed to be enjoying herself and stayed for longer than she intended but it just wasn’t the same.

I still thought it went really well but at the end she said that “she didn’t feel any chemistry but she would really like to hang out again as friends”, I just felt like I was punched in the stomach when she said that. I still feel pain in my stomach right now, I told her over text that I’m down to be friends but our conversation doesn’t feel the same, I guess I just still feel pain so it’s hard for me to try to make her laugh and what not so I think I’ll pause on texting her for a bit

I just can’t get it out of my head, I feel like an idiot, I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up, I shouldn’t have talked about such a stupid topic and I should’ve flirted with her to make a romantic feeling but I thought I didn’t need to cuz she seemed so interested. 

I just don’t know what to do, I just feel like I was so close to finding someone I could learn about what love is like with. She just made me feel on top of the world those 3 hours and I of course had to find a way to fuck it up. I can’t help but feel I’m doomed, I feel like I’ll never find a girl I like as much as her. I just want to know how to get this off of my mind, my stomach hurts, I can’t eat very much, I can’t focus even though I have finals, I’ve tried exercising and doing things to take my mind off but I still feel so hurt. I just want to feel what true love is like. I wish I could cry and feel sorry for myself a little bit but I just feel angry at myself, I just can’t shake the feeling I fucked that up",1,ive mentally decided try dating best date life sweet beatiful girl cant help feel fucked getting affectionate half felt cared way havent felt long time unfortunately got touchy subject thought alright ended think sore spot lot affectionate closed enjoying stayed longer intended wasnt thought went end said didnt feel chemistry like hang friends felt like punched stomach said feel pain stomach right told tet im friends conversation doesnt feel guess feel pain hard try laugh think ill pause teting bit cant head feel like idiot shouldnt gotten hopes shouldnt talked stupid topic shouldve flirted romantic feeling thought didnt need cuz interested dont know feel like close finding learn love like feel world 3 hours course find way fuck cant help feel im doomed feel like ill find girl like want know mind stomach hurts cant eat cant focus finals ive tried eercising things mind feel hurt want feel true love like wish cry feel sorry little bit feel angry cant shake feeling fucked

2523,"Hey people. I have always had problems with socialising and making friends. I even switched school's because I couldn't make ANY friends. My parents thought that this school I go to currently will help me make friends but what happened next is the complete opposite. I was in a new class with new people and had to start over. Mind you this was in 3rd grade. I wrote all my classmate's names in a piece of paper and tried to make friends with them. But I had to switch classes and had to start over AGAIN. This section however was filled with condescending dicks who bullied EVERYDAY. And I couldn't tell this to my parents as they would complain to my teacher which would further reduce my chances of making friends. So now I had to try and make friends with literal dumbarses who bullied every single day and mind you I WAS STILL IN 3RD GRADE! This continued untill 5th grade where I was thankfully given a very good teacher to rely upon. Same goes for 6th grade too. Amazing teacher and overall best year by FAR. But from here there will be no good years AT.ALL.

&#x200B;

7th grade ruined my motivation for life. Terrible teacher and worst bulling ever. Everyone had their own group of friend and seeing them in field trips or during PE made me terribly depressed. I decided if I'm not making any friends might as well use my time studying like hell! Then I will pass all exams and make loads and loads of friends right? Riiight? Nope. Not at all. Just before my final exam of the year I studied till 11:30 PM. During the actual test I found all questions to be a slice of delicious lemon cake. Or easy. But I had gotten  16%. Out of 100%. Then came the blitzkrieg of bullying. Fat shaming, calling me a retard and making fun of me. At this point I had given up on life completely and my only hope was to seek a therapist. And i didnt tell any of this bullying to my parents. Like a idiot i kept all of it in me. Eventually this sadness took over me and has made a shell of what I used to be. Optimistic, Extroverted, Happy and smiling. Now I'm Introverted, pessimistic, suicidal, and self hating. I always thought of myself as a happy guy which loads of talent. Now I think of myself as waste of sperm cells. I told my parents about this and they said and I quote, ""What problems do you have which you have to be depressed about?!"" And they would refuse to get me a therapist or psychologist. I have no-one in my life who cares about me and am very close to jumping off Of a building. Whoever  is seeing this, help me. Only you guys in this subreddit can give tips. Thanks.

2540,"  Where do I even start? I grew up with my father not being present to just becoming straight up abusive. My mother went from caring and protective, to a woman who seemed dead inside who is just starting to come back to life after much therapy. I've had thousands of dollars stolen or just taken from me by them. I was broke the entire time, emotionally abused, abandoned, and beaten. I left home at eighteen to go live with another family. Came out as a trans woman then had to go move to bum fuck Florida after their marriage blew the hell up. The new families husband wound up being emotionally abusive toward me so I had to cut him off entirely. Then the wife of the new family became emotionally and I'm now thinking I might have to cut her out. 

 I moved to Richmond and am at VCU in some kind of attempt to maybe live a semi successful life, but I'm border line failing my classes due to having no meds, no insurance, and just being dumb as hell,  so now I am desperately trying to find a trans friendly doctor in Richmond, and I'm just scared and alone, and don't want to go back to moving around and fuck. Just fuck. 

  I'm trying my best with summer school, but everything is moving so fast, and I can't keep up when all I want to do is curl up in a ball and just stem and cry myself to sleep. 

I don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to be, or what's going to happen next.

Hi , im a 31 yr old living at home cos of circumstances. My family is not great, i feel so overwhelmed all the time, while they are not outright bad people, we are just a dysfunctional family . To make matters worse i have no space of my own, i dont have a room , i have to share my room, theres no place i can be at peace and just think , and whatever time i find alone , i waste brooding and doing the bad coping skills ive developed like mindlessly scrolling social media. Despite my mental problems whenever i try to get my life on track something or the other drama happens and i have to recover from that. I wish i was self absorbed person but im highly attuned to other people and it just drains me. Im poor i cant find lodgings of my own, im trying to apply to a school, but i feel so depressed sometimes i feel like giving it all up. I dont want to list my problems here cos its endless, and i feel physically weak from my situation. And the pandemic has made things worse, the libraries are closed , i cant even go there. I just want to be at peace with myself and remember that my life matters, and that i can focus on getting out of here, because everything just overwhelms me . I live in a 3rd world country so all the mental health infrastructures are BS, if anyone can teach me how to cope, it would be great . Thanks

Why did you leave me?

Why did you leave me?

Why am I so alone? Where are all the people who used to be in my life? Where are all the people I loved? Where are all the people without whom I could not live? Where are the too many guests at my birthday party?

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry.

2690,"Basically since the pandemic started I've been smoking at least 3 days a week. That number has been constant all throughout the past year and is what I am at now. There has been some periods of time where I would get high for around 5 - 10+ hours a day, everyday--and the worst of it was when I did it for 3 weeks straight. At first I did it out of sheer curiousity for the drug, but now I've experienced all that and it ends up being my go-to as a fix for whenever I am depressed, lonely, or feeling empty. 

I've really fucked myself here, I recognize it as a problem but I've relied on it for so long for that emotional boost/remedy that going without it for 3 days (usually) leaves me in a state of depression, devoid of emotion or interest in anything--and at worst, very intense self deprecation which makes me contemplate suicide. I've tried to quit plenty of times but I just cant seem to overcome this hurdle. 

Also do you know those random moments of feeling empty that you get in social gatherings, events, etc. ? I've been getting those since I was 12, about 8 years ago. I've gotten them probably over a hundred times now and I can definitely say that at the start they were due to feelings of lonelyness and not feeling a sense of belonging anywhere, but now I cant even tell. It'd start off randomly, clearing my head of any thoughts, which will then lead me to stress about my problems (i stress SUPER easily especially about anything long term). I just get in my head and pick apart anything I dont like about myself or anything around me. I'd get an intense feeling of anger, self-hate, lonelyness, shame, sadness, or emptyness depending on what I am venting about in my thoughts. But recently it keeps routing back to self-hate where I'd end up seriously bullying myself for my actions and thoughts because deep down I truly feel like a sack of shit unwelcome anywhere I'd go.

Any time I am even remotely close to a slow progression to quitting weed I'd get this 'random moment,' completely fucking up my momentum. Literally anything could trigger it now; a random fight with a friend, a pet peeve being triggered, anxiety and overthinking about myself, etc. With classes propping up again a month from now, I cant even imagine what a fucking mess I'd be if I cant even handle the summer with the least interactions with anything.

Right now I am on my 4th day of not smoking. It is really tough on me right now. 4 days ago I started to get stressed on just my own personal problems, with repeated headaches that I still have right now. The 4th day kinda sounds like an achievement considering 3 days is usually my limit but this is only due to me working a summer job which leaves me less time to smoke. Another reason that I've made it this far is thay I cant even sleep for more than 2 hours at a time--I've only gotten 9 hours total since sunday night. I honestly dont know how I am still functioning but I do drink multiple coffees a day and it feels like I am on the brink of collapsing soon. I'm writing this right now unable to sleep, with me needing to leave for work in a couple of hours without feeling a single thing so I am sorry that this whole thing looks messy. I know I glossed over some topics without specific details. Heck I dont even know if I am posting this just to rant or share my experience or ask for advice.

None of my friends know that this is how badly depressed I am feeling inside. I sometimes let it leak out with sarcastic cries for help hoping that one of my friends will notice but thats as selfish I'd go with this. I dont want to shoulder my emotional baggage onto someone but fuck it sucks to feel this way inside.

2706,"So i didn't have a totally amazing family growing up and this last decade has been really rough on my mental state. I'm 24(m) goin on 25 this year and I've been having mental breakdowns just about every other night to the point where i cry myself to sleep lately. My mom had an abusive alcoholic/meth addict boyfriend, and my brother was a heroine addict and I'm pretty sure my mom was back on meth for a while too during all the bullshit. This was going on a lot back when i was still in high school, there was constant fighting going on and i ended up hardly going to school cause i was always worried about what was gonna happen at home. It got so bad to the point where one day one of my teachers even flat out asked me what's going on at my home. But i grew up with my shitty family (mostly my brother) always telling me ""snitches get stiches"" so i kept my mouth shut. And i was already 18 anyways so not like the school could've done anything either way since i was considered an adult. But between school and constant drama at home i was stressed and i ended up dropping out just cause i couldn't focus on my school work. Flash forward a couple years later after i dropped out things kept going on and i ended up finding out my dad was dying. My mom and i finally got her shitty boyfriend out of our lives and she was finally getting her head out of her ass but we were still dealing with my brother. He was still causing drama and it was so bad to the point where we could hardly leave our apartment cause he was basically trying to turn it into a drug house. He already caused us to lose one home and i wasn't about to let him cause us to be homeless again. I really wanted to visit my dad more cause me and him hardly got to spend any time together cause his wife kept moving them further and further away from us and we didn't have a lot of money either for gas and she knew this too. But i didn't wanna leave our home cause i was more worried about what my shitty brother would've done to the place and all his druggy friends. My dad ended up dying and i never got to have some form of closure with him and i feel so fucking guilty about it like i know he loved me and wanted the best for me and all that but the guilt i feel just fucking hurts like i think about it damn near everyday. My brother is finally clean and finally doing better but everytime we try to have any real conversation and i try to talk about how i feel he always guilt trips me. and whenever i try to talk to my mom about everything she always just tells me to ""get over it"". She only wants to hear what she wants me to say she always tries to tell me that we need family counseling or therapy or some shit but i really don't want any of that cause all they're gonna do is put me on some anti depression meds like i really don't wanna rely on some fucking pills to make me happy all i really want is just some kind of closure. It's honestly at that point to where i just don't give a damn anymore about either of them. Like once i save up enough to get my own place I'm seriously tempted to just block both of them from my life.",1,didnt totally amazing family growing decade rough mental state im 24 m goin 25 year ive having mental breakdowns night point cry sleep lately mom abusive alcoholic meth addict boyfriend brother heroine addict im pretty sure mom meth bullshit going lot high school constant fighting going ended hardly going school cause worried gonna happen home got bad point day teachers flat asked whats going home grew shitty family brother telling snitches stiches kept mouth shut 18 anyways like school couldve way considered adult school constant drama home stressed ended dropping cause couldnt focus school work flash forward couple years later dropped things kept going ended finding dad dying mom finally got shitty boyfriend lives finally getting head ass dealing brother causing drama bad point hardly leave apartment cause basically trying turn drug house caused lose home wasnt let cause homeless wanted visit dad cause hardly got spend time cause wife kept moving away didnt lot money gas knew didnt wanna leave home cause worried shitty brother wouldve place druggy friends dad ended dying got form closure feel fucking guilty like know loved wanted best guilt feel fucking hurts like think damn near everyday brother finally clean finally better everytime try real conversation try talk feel guilt trips try talk mom tells wants hear wants tries tell need family counseling therapy shit dont want cause theyre gonna anti depression meds like dont wanna rely fucking pills happy want kind closure honestly point dont damn anymore like save place im seriously tempted block life

so this morning, i told my mother that i need help. she asked me what my problem was and i honestly answered, “it’s me, there’s just some things in my head and this time i can’t handle it on my own.” she went on by saying that im an entitled kid for wanting so many things, that those aren’t real problems, and that she was “depressed” too when she was the same age as mine. she said suck it up because she won’t be paying for therapy sessions because they dont really work and they just give out sleeping pills. she even shamed me in my family group chat by sharing posts of “real-life problems.”

Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it. But as each weekend goes by, I get closer to overcoming the fear.

2801,"I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.

I'm ""only"" (""only"" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel ""old"" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.

A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.

I see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.

I can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.

The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my ""dream"", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.

It's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).

One of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of ""enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are"". Time itself is part of the ""specifications"" of my goal.

30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so ""ambitious"" or ""demanding"" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.

Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.

I'm 20 years old, 21 in a few weeks. My life has changed a lot this year and I thought it would be good. But with every day that passes, I feel more and more tired and unmotivated.

I lived in a very toxic household for years. My step father and I never had a good relationship but it kept declining over the years, to the point of pointless arguments with my mother about small stuff. I was working on a restaurant with a horrible boss that made me feel like shit everyday.

Slowly things started to change. I got out my house and live alone now and changed jobs to a better one. But still, I feel stuck somehow.I blamed my unhappiness on my previous situations but changing then didn't help anything.

I have a small group of friends but still feel very lonely. I can't see a couple walking in the street without feeling bad about myself.

In the past week or so, I just cry myself to sleep. I played a lot of video games to distract myself but now I can't play for more than 30 minutes before feeling exhausted and bored. I force myself to do it only to not think about my current mental situation.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know we are in charge of our own happiness but I just can't stop feeling like I need someone to show me I'm worthed.

Life in general is becoming such a burden that my fear of death is no longer a valid excuse to not think about ending it...

If you think you can help somehow, I would be very thankful. I really need a pick me up.

Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.

Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok. I recently told them that I would appreciate it if they wouldn't bring up God anymore and they said if you can't accept him then we have nothing else to say to you. They won't return my calls or text anymore. Now I have no one. I've been laying in bed everyday untill I have to go to work then when I get off I just sleep untill work again.

2883,"I feel as though I mask my depression well. No one would ever even know. And yet, I think about killing myself almost every single day. There was one time that my visions of self harm were too vivid and I often think back on that time. I always wondered if the way in which you picture taking your own life says something. I always pictured placing a knife to my heart and running into a wall. The one day I was working, I started having those thoughts and I used to work in food preparations so I had this huge machete in hand. My urges became so strong that I scared myself. I clocked out early and I sat outside my church. I sat there for hours, begging God to be touched in some way. I just wanted a reason to stay, but I felt nothing.. absolutely nothing. And so I went home and I’ve had moments after that where I thought I felt God but I feel that I’ve lost that part of myself. I’ve stopped believing and yet my fear of hell is the reason I haven’t taken my life yet. I feel like a waste of space, a waste of life. I have no meaning to my life anymore- I no longer get joy out of the things I once had.I think a lot about how if I died today that the world would keep turning or maybe that it would even be a little bit better. I don’t understand why I even have these thoughts but I do. Some days I don’t even see that there’s another option. I just wish I knew that things would get better but they haven’t for so long. I’m sorry if my thoughts don’t blend together but I was typing as these words came to mind. I wish my mind would be normal for once and that I could just genuinely laugh again, to feel again.

2915,"Hmm. I can't think of a good title that isn't generic. I'll say it's a normal suicidewatch wall of text.I'll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself.  If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.

I'll try to be short and concise.  Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before.

Currently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes 

Backstory: 6 years college - dropped out,  many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses,  choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential

5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything.  I hated myself and everyone.  I was angry, frustrated and sad.  As the years progressed I became more isolated.  As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago.  I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk.  I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.

It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change.  My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart.  I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that.  When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored.  I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect.  I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong.  I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored.  

I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light.  There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can.  I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies.  Am I right?  I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.

Anyway, I see my lack of motivation.  But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things.  I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over.  Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again.  

A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure.  If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate.  I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle.  My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on.  I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades.  I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times.  I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month.  

I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive.  My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help.  I worry about every pain and problem with my body.  I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me.  There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal.  There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place.  I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe.  When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone.  I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly.  I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing.  I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. 

Anyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up.  Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to.  I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy.  I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it.  They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself.  I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.  

Holy shit.  What a wall of text.  I can't even TL;DR it because it still feels like I missed the point.

2959,"***TW: emotional, physical ab\*se, suic\*de, self-in\*\*ry***

Hello. I'm Nozomi (not my real name for anon). First of all, I just want to thank this community for creating a safe space for topics like this and for welcoming me. I've been a lurker of online communities like this and recently decided to create another Reddit account to officially join as I am very anxious to even browse around content as such with my real identity.

I am in an unhealthy environment and I have been planning to move out for years now because of my suicidal tendencies that are brought upon by the situation that I am in. I have not been able to successfully do this because of the lack of job opportunities that welcome me and my mental health condition, and the lack of financial support. I do have a job now that is better for my mental health and is promising finance-wise but it will take me months to be able to earn a specific amount of income to move out safely and I don't know how long I have until the next episode I'll have in this toxic household. The pandemic has made it all worse for me and my productivity having to survive and work for myself in this place 24/7.

I was advised that I could reach out for help from online communities like this but I'm still very skeptical of the idea that people would be able to help while I stay anonymous. I feel like the act of raising funds to be able to move out without anyone knowing my real identity, is far from possible and may just be seen as a scam, or worse, risk being found out about my abusive family but I also can't pass up ANY opportunity to finally get out of this situation. **What do you guys think I should do?**

I decided to get help and have this posted around online communities that I feel safe in to gather advice if this is possible, how to go about it and if there are other feasible ways that I can save up to move out. I know this is going to be a very long post but I feel that in order for me to get help, I need to give context as to what my situation is.

As many of you all, I am a product of two abusive parents who are not together anymore but are both still able to hurt their children. I'm in my early 20s, living with my emotionally and physically abusive mom and 2 of my siblings. Saying the words abusive along with introducing who my parents are, especially my mom makes me extremely anxious for the reason that for a long time, I believed that everything was normal and that I was loved and cared for, but the difference was that the kind of ""love"" they gave me involved hitting me, screaming hurtful words at me, and showing subtle reminders that I am always wrong, to teach me lessons. After slowly realizing and growing out of that belief, I have also observed the ways that they gaslight and guilt-trip their children into thinking that resisting against them is an act of sin, selfishness, and ungratefulness. And yes, even now, at the time that I am writing this, the feeling of being a cruel daughter, a selfish and ungrateful one, is lingering. But the fact that I have tried so hard and so many times to see and feel that I am loved, to bond, to reconnect, and to even heal with them, only to feel disappointed, hurt, and even feel sort of shocked sometimes to be reminded that the home I'm looking for is nowhere near where these people are.

I badly care for my parents and I still love my mom so much but most days with her feel like I'm not wanted and that she shouldn't have had me. I remember when I used to be that little kid in the corner of the room sobbing and struggling to breathe after my dad had just whipped whatever he had in his hand at my small body, with my mom watching, they would insist that it was just because they loved me and for a while, I really believed that people who hurt you could also just love you.

My sister also grew up in this situation but I took most of the hits for her as well because my parents used to say that it was because I was the eldest and whatever wrong my sister did was my fault, and I really didn't mind most of the hits I took for her, because she was so small and it hurt a lot. I think my brother never experienced that level of physical abuse my dad did but he gets a few minor hits here and there from my mom now and my sister and I don't get hit anymore. My brother shows a lot of verbal resistance from my mom's physical abuse and I remember a time when he even brought up the actual words of ""child abuse"" at her and I was so scared for him that time. I remember my mom was upset at it but the hitting didn't get worse, thankfully.

Out of all my siblings, I'm considered as the black sheep because I show most of the resistance to how we're brought up, and because of this, I get most of the amount of abuse that I and my siblings get from our parents, but I do know that less abuse is still abuse. They do get better treatment than I get and they also somehow hate me because I'm pictured as the selfish member of the family for being the most sensitive, dramatic, and needy sibling, also most probably because I distance myself from them and I'm always unhappy and upset to be around with when I'm around family. I badly want to work as hard as I can to get them out of this situation but I can't help them if I can't even help myself.

The situation now looks like this. My parents are separated, we live with our mom, my dad has his other kids and girlfriend to go home to but he visits us every other week or so. My dad is the worst, every time that he's here at home, I distance myself as much as I can because he just makes me extremely uncomfortable and every interaction we have that goes for more than 10 seconds turns into a big argument, and sometimes, him threatening to hit me, and every time this happens, I go into a full breakdown, he leaves as if nothing happened, I go into a full month of dysfunction and suicidal breakdowns that my mom would notice and be mad about. He would come to visit a few weeks after as if nothing happened and I would try to forget and try to come back from the dead to avoid being more of a disappointment to my mom.

My mom is a different story. She used to hit us less which made me believe that she was kind because she hit us less and she said she didn't like hitting us but as I grew up I think she just didn't like to be painted as the bad guy. I've always felt like she hated me, she has always said negative things about me, straightforward and subtle. About how I look, act, and talk, and I have always felt uncomfortable around her because she has always made me feel ugly and worthless. People, and I think she believes this too, see her as this kind woman who is never angry and never confrontational but I see a different woman at home.

I used to think that I was finally not scared of my parents anymore because my dad isn't around that much anymore and I've gotten good at hiding stuff from my mom but I have always been scared of her. I feel that I'm on the lookout 24/7. Every move I make is criticized and every move she makes, I have to analyze. Is she angry? Is she about to say something hurtful now? What is the safest thing to do in order not to upset her? and other things I constantly am anxious about.

She doesn't hit me anymore but she does and says things that still make me fear for my safety. One time, she was cooking and was using a knife while being upset at me and I honestly had to sit up just enough to be ready for whatever it is that's about to happen, but I believe the emotional abuse is what keeps me at my lowest ever since my dad left us. I know she's hurt and I feel so bad for how she's hurt but hurt people really do hurt people don't they?

I have read about narcissistic parents across communities like this and for a while, I really didn't want to believe that my mom is a narcissistic mother but the more I recognize the signs from over the years of living with her issues, I can say that she has narcissistic tendencies that result to her being emotionally abusive.

One time, I had the stupidest mistake to tell our school counselor about my suicidal thoughts about the toxic household I'm in and what they decided to do was call my mom in. Of course, I got home to my mom visibly upset, crying, screaming, and telling me how ungrateful I am, asking me where she went wrong about raising such a child. That was the same reaction she had when she found out about me cutting up my wrists. This is why I've always been extremely anxious about reaching out for help myself.

I could list down all the nasty and horrible shit that goes down in this household between me and this family but this post is getting very long and it takes a lot of energy from me to relay all of these painful things but my objective with this post is to really get advice on how to safely move out. If you may ask me how I'd be able to maintain taking care of myself if I am to live on my own, I have a job that is kind to my brain and I enjoy it so much but having to develop this promising job to get me a stable income, in an environment that I'm in is like trying to take care of a perfectly healthy and happy fish in contaminated water. It's so bad here that I'd be the happiest I'd ever be in an empty apartment alone.

That's it for now. I'd welcome any questions and hopefully suggestions. Again, thank you so much for this safe space. **I am so grateful to know that I am not alone ❤️**

**📌 TL:DR: In an unhealthy environment with suicidal tendencies, not sure if anonymously raising funds online to get me out is possible, might be seen as a scam but I'm open to suggestions, working on a promising job to get me on a stable income, but it will me take months to be able to move out safely, working in a toxic environment delays it all, would raising funds be a good idea to at least take me out of here safely?**",1,tw emotional physical abse suicde selfinry hello im nozomi real anon want thank community creating safe space topics like welcoming ive lurker online communities like

I didnt know submission was 3rd August. By the time I realised, there was only 5 hours left to research it and have historians and primary sources etc.

I only managed to get 1500 words down. I knew what to say i just didnt have time. Anyway when I submitted it, it took long to submit so it was 1 minute late. If you are 1 minute late you get a 0. So i failed and I messed up. It was a really important exam too.

I have never failed a real exam before. And honestly I just cried the second I realised it submitted 1 minute late.

Whats worse is I have 8 other essays to do in 6 days. And tbh im so depressed that they arent getting done either. I dont get another chance after this. I get kicked out of uni so ✌

3011,"I‘ve been depressed for a long time although I can’t say for how long. Maybe middle school, if what I experienced then would classify, which is always hard to say in retrospect - but I’ve most definitely been depressed since high school, on-and-off. I‘ve always dealt with self-critical thoughts; they‘re there all the time and while they‘ve improved with therapy, they’re part of me even on the good days. It’s been ups and downs for years now and I‘ve been on Sertraline for a long time but now, after a first psychiatrist‘s appointment in a really long time, I‘ve been given the option to switch from Sertraline to Venflaxine. The Sertraline helped to some extent, I don’t SH anymore, back when I started it I noticed an improvement but it’s just… anti-climactic, especially after all these years. It‘s like I‘m still depressed, it‘s just harder to feel it, if that makes sense. I‘ve read up on Venflaxine on reddit and other forums and here the consensus seems to be „Hell Drug Don‘t Take It“ which, I have to say, really disappointed me. I‘m just hoping I can finally be like the people around me, can finally feel like I‘m doing the right things, can finally sense what I want and follow it. I want out of this weird limbo of acting like I’m fine, thinking I’m probably fine and just making up problems because I look at the world wrong and it’s all my fault and straight-up stopping to give a shit about what happens and accepting I’m fucking miserable. It’s gotta be easier than that, right? How do all the people around me not go batshit if they experience the same things I am, if everyone’s hearing this incessant nagging to some degree, day-in, day-out. I still don‘t know if I should just suck it up and get my shit together or if I‘m valid in vocalizing that I‘m in pain, at least 50% of the time? I just want an easy fix at this point. I want a medication that works, something that‘ll have me feeling like I‘m good enough and resilient and happy, where I can go to social gatherings without the constant thoughts of how large I am compared to everyone else here, or how maybe I’m boring and stupid after all or how everyone’s just straight up *superior* to me (and tbf it’s not always this way but it’s never *not* to some extent this way). Is that too much to ask? Am I just dramatizing everything right now because I’m sitting somewhere between a depressive episode, PMS and sleep deprivation? If you have hopeful stories for me, please tell me them, be it about Venflaxine or improving in general. I’m sick of feeling so bad about myself. Also please, no Venflaxine horror stories, I’ve read them, I know them - if you have a negative experience to share, please word it carefully. I need to hear someone tell me it can get better even after years of it getting a little better but simply going from horrible to not so good.",1,ive depressed long time cant long maybe middle school eperienced classify hard retrospect ive definitely depressed high school onandoff ive dealt selfcritical thoughts theyre time theyve improved therapy theyre good days ups downs years ive sertraline long time psychiatrists appointment long time ive given option switch sertraline venflaine sertraline helped etent dont anymore started noticed improvement anticlimactic especially years like im depressed harder feel makes sense ive read venflaine reddit forums consensus hell drug dont disappointed im hoping finally like people finally feel like im right things finally sense want follow want weird limbo acting like im fine thinking im probably fine making problems look world wrong fault straightup stopping shit happens accepting im fucking miserable gotta easier right people batshit eperience things everyones hearing incessant nagging degrees dayin dayout dont know suck shit im valid vocalizing im pain 50 time want easy fi point want medication works thatll feeling like im good resilient happy social gatherings constant thoughts large compared maybe im boring stupid everyones straight superior tbe way etent way ask dramatizing right im sitting depressive episode pas sleep deprivation hopeful stories tell venflaine improving general im sick feeling bad venflaine horror stories ive read know negative eperience share word carefully need hear tell better years getting little better simply going horrible good

3047,"So today it was dropped on me that I need to plan to move out of where I’m living as my housemates who own the house want to sell and buy a new place for their future together. 

Some background - my best friend and her partner, also my very close friend live together and in January of this year I found myself having to move out of where I lived and not knowing where to go. They said I could live with them for as long as I needed and so I moved in. I am disabled and because of that I do not work and am on benefits. I pay rent but it is only what I can afford not what it should actually be. They both make good money and have a good lifestyle that I kinda tag along in by default and I’m super appreciative of that. 

So today BF said to me that they were talking and they want to sell and buy somewhere for them, and they are starting to plan their future together/ long term working from home arrangements and possibly kids. She wants at least a month with me out so she can arrange the house for selling and she wants to have moved by (I think she said) March next year. 

I understand all that, I really do. But I am still a little hurt, feel a little rejected, a little betrayed. I wish they had not said for me to move in with them in the first place as then I wouldn’t be looking to move again right now. 

They want to support me, help me plan, do whatever to help me work out what I’m going to do. She offered me to not pay rent so I can save some money for a deposit, as I have no savings. But it seems pointless as then what, I’ll have a deposit to live somewhere I can’t afford long term? Also I’ll feel like a charity case. 

Anyway, I’m really depressed atm anyway and have been struggling with wanting to unalive myself, but now I have to plan for a future I’m not even sure I want? Idk what to do. 

I think I want to move far away, maybe by the coast in the north where money goes further. But maybe that’s just me trying to run away. 

Any tips on what I should do? Other than you know, unalive myself which looks more attractive by the hour.",1,today dropped need plan im living housemates house want sell buy new place future background best friend partner close friend live january year found having lived knowing got said live long needed moved disabled work benefits pay rent afford actually good money good lifestyle kinda tag default im super appreciative today said talking want sell buy starting plan future long term working home arrangements possibly kids wants month arrange house selling wants moved think said march net years understand little hurt feel little rejected little betrayed wish said place wouldnt looking right want support help plan help work im going offered pay rent save money deposit savings pointless ill deposit live cant afford long terms ill feel like charity case im depressed atm struggling wanting unlive plan future im sure want ink think want far away maybe coast north money goes maybe thats trying run away tips know unlive looks attractive hours

When I get saddest is when I think of all the time I lost during COVID. We were so excited about seeing each other again. I miss him. I miss my mom. I miss my family friend.

Why then, does my sadness manifest itself in such a weird fucking way? Why do I not cry when I think of these people, but cry when I watch a television show, and then cry some more when flashes of scenes from the show pop into my brain later? Even when it's not a sad episode from Community. Is it just the fictional relationships making me wish I wasn't so alone right now? Is it the stress of having to pack for travelling to attend the funeral, find out my suit no longer fits (I'm considerably more of a fat ass these days) and then the release of that stress later when I'm able to find clothes that fit? Is it the continued stress of having to travel and make it to the funeral, and feeling like I won't look my best (even though I know it won't matter)?

I know how Community ends (I've watched it several times), so am I sad when I think of the show simply because it reminds me of the passage of time, and friends being inseparable, yet they still have to move on with their lives? It reminds me that I'm in a state of arrested development and flux, and being reminded of the passage of time reminds me that I'm losing more and more people from my life, and gaining now new ones. 

My real relationships are slowly being replaced by fictional ones. I have to do something. I don't even know how to talk to anyone about this because it all just sounds so sad and pathetic. I feel like a gigantic loser.",1,family friend died recently wouldnt close definitely loved ive known life illness wanted tet didnt know got point wouldnt mattered said breathing person gone maybe said think dont feel regret im sad distraught epected time lost dad earlier years somewhat suddenly dont think ive copied dont think ive copied losing mom 20 years ago time personal change ecitement stress aniety said lost dad things going saddest think time lost couid ecited seeing miss miss mom miss family friend sadness manifest weird fucking way cry think people cry watch television cry flashes scenes pop brain later sad episode community fictional relationships making wish wasnt right stress having pack travelling attend funeral find suit longer fits im considerably fat ass days release stress later im able find clothes fit continued stress having travel funeral feeling like wont look best know wont matter know community ends ive watched times sad think simply reminds passage time friends inseparable lives reminds im state arrested development flu reminded passage time reminds im losing people life gaining new ones real relationships slowly replaced fictional ones dont know talk sounds sad pathetic feel like gigantic loser
3054,"My husband has been depressed on and off for a couple years now. He won't get help and it's finally wearing on me. When it first started he'd yell at me and cry everyday. Now he just cries almost everyday. I have been understanding for a couple years now that this isn't him and he doesn't mean to hurt me or be mean because he's just depressed.

I dread waking up and at this rate I just dread every single day. I make majority of the meals so now I just make bland easy food because I am burnt out and no longer feel creative or enjoy cooking. Hell I don't even enjoy eating anymore. It's just become another chore in life. I keep the house clean to the bare minimum so I don't get yelled at, but still sometimes he gets frustrated and just yells. At least it's no longer about me. Just about how he hates this apartment. 

Every minor inconvenience throws him through an emotional loop and I used to brush it off, but now it makes me literally sick to my stomach with anxiety. I used to try and do everything to make him feel better/happier/more comfortable, but nothing works and now I'm just depressed. I try to always be there and let him talk through his feelings, but it leads nowhere. 

He doesn't want help and at this rate I wish someone would just put me out of my misery. I can't do this anymore. This is not how I wanted my life to go and now I'm stuck with someone who is miserable no matter what and there's nothing that makes it better because he won't get help. My cup is empty. I have been slowly chipped away and now I have nothing to give to anyone. I'm completely tapped out and just want it to end. 

No one on the outside knows how miserable I am and he hides it well too so I can't confide in anyone. I can't even confide in him. I tried opening up, but he couldn't handle it and yelled at me and left, so I learned I can't rely on him to be there for me for longer than 2 weeks. Whatever feelings I have need to be either solved or hidden after 2 weeks. I'm all alone and my dog is the only reason I'm even still doing the bare minimum with life.",1,husband depressed couple years wont help finally wearing started hed yell cry everyday cries everyday understanding couple years isnt doesnt mean hurt mean hes depressed dread waking rate dread single day majority meals bland easy food burnt longer feel creative enjoy cooking hell dont enjoy eating anymore chore life house clean bare minimum dont yelled gets frustrated yells longer hates apartment minor inconvenience throws emotional loop brush makes literally sick stomach aniety try feel better happier comfortable works im depressed try let talk feelings leads doesnt want help rate wish misery cant anymore wanted life im stuck miserable matter theres makes better wont help cup slowly chipped away im completely tapped want end outside knows miserable hides cant confide cant confide tried opening couldnt handle yelled left learned cant rely longer 2 weeks feelings need solved hidden 2 weeks im dog reason im bare minimum life

3081,"I don't think i'll kill myself over this but this will definitely up the chancesHi /r/SuicideWatch so there's been a lot going on over the last year or so much more than I feel I want to type up in a post as it could take me all day but basically I've been fighting a losing battle for a while now but small victory's are helping me get through the worst parts for example i passed my driving theory test two days ago :).

Anyway ill give you some background so you can help me with these problems, so around two years ago i was 16 got into my first real relationship with a girl named abbey about 9 months into the relationship she got really drunk at a party she got really angry at me when i told her to slow down a bit and tried to make out with one of my friends at the party needless to say it didn't work he didn't make out with her, for the remaining months of our relationship she acted extremely distant and unloving as i showered her with praise until around February last year I broke up with her. A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was  disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....

Between that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.

ok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).

 I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.

what should I do.",1,dont think ill kill definitely chances r suicidewatch theres lot going year feel want type post day basically ive fighting losing battle small victorys helping worst parts eample passed driving theory test days ago ill background help problems years ago 16 got real relationship girl named abbey 9 months relationship got drunk party got angry told slow bit tried friends party needless didnt work didnt remaining months relationship acted etremely distant unloving showered praise february year broke bad good break time etremly sad able calmly talk come understanding mother time told disappointed wouldnt literally days said raised wrong im fucked time got job mcdonalds hated quit got kicked house got forced house normal school issues dont mind school rampant suicidal thoughts generally scared future sad life time abbey message wed talk couple days stopped stopped having feelings couldnt talk feeling like shit ok heres real problem started talking months ago ended started having casual se weekly know great idea said begging chose date people ok stop friends asked couple days ago im ok went date told lied couldnt come round went worked tets try today worked http imgurcom 927ho read left bit hope gives general gist im trying honestly fell love dont think thats know

3100,"i ended up reaching out to a couple of people today to try and just verbalize my thoughts on how i'm feeling.  depression and suicide have consumed me.  i'm literally having problems doing basic things.  living by myself without any interaction with humans (or having humans even close by) is pretty shitty.

my mother:

""you have to want to get help"" and
""there must be something out there that can help"" (referencing medication)

and the other person...

""you are focusing too much on therapy and drug options""

as someone that has experienced different prescription drugs, i have some knowledge of the long/short term impact.  i also have had therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists that have sucked.  i've had some that were just okay.

living with this year after year is exhausting.  i'm tired of thinking.  i'm tired of not experiencing joy or contentment.  everything is miserable (in my head).  i can't predict the future, but doesn't past experience indicate what might be ahead?

i'm at a point where i've experienced enough to know what is possible in (my) life. i have no kids or pets.  somewhere in my posting history i said something about just trying to see the next day.  i'm just surviving.  i've felt like that most of my life.  this is it.  i'm looking at my reality.  this is how i've experienced life.

lately i just keep telling myself that i will be alone.  i've never felt like i've been part of a community.

I think I got the worst body combination ever. I'm a 19 year old latino that is short (5 foot 5), REALLY skinny (110lbs) and got really crooked/crowded bottom teeth. I try my best to not let it get to me I really do, but everytime I look in the mirror, grab my skinny wrists, walk among people who are taller than me I just can't help but feel pathetic. I don't even feel like leaving my house, I'm anxiously scared of there being that one jerk that humiliates me and makes fun of me. Cause it's always been like that, ever since I was a kid. 

I'm trying to work out, but I gotta eat more. And me feeling depressed takes away my appetite and it's just a whole endless cycle. Girls don't like me, dudes make fun of me, even my family (not mom and dad) always point out how short and scrawny I am. Everyday that passes I just feel more and more down.

3127,"I've been dealing with depression since I was 15 years old, then bulimia, pretty severe OCD/Anxiety, ADHD probably all due to trauma I suffered from my adoption and time spent in the orphanage. I wasn't held or attuned to at all and to this day have really bad attachment patterns that feel impossible to overcome. I dont really have any close friends and being depressed only makes it harder to communicate and actually enjoy socializing. I've been preoccupied with suicidal thoughts and don't know what to do next, I don't know anybody else with my type of trauma and that feels especially isolating.

Maybe it's because I don't have an outlet to confide in. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. But guess what? I can't. I can't talk about my problems to someone I know.

But just when I think it's finally going to happen, I'm finally going to release my pent up stress and feelings, I stop myself. 

I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.

3167,"So I've struggled with mental illness basically my entire life. I've been in therapy for more than a decade. Recently it occurred to me that I actually can't remember how it feels to not be depressed and in my case, also dissociatiated.

It's not my first time being hospitalized. I was once when I was 14 or 15 and then when i was 16 i was in a weird sorta half school/ half mental hospital clinic place.

I'm just not sure if I should do it. Mostly because I'm worried I might lose my job or something, because I'm in no shape to actually contact them and figure out the paperwork.

At the same time. I just spent the last 45 minutes picking up and putting down a knife just debating if I want to feel something or not. I can't get myself to eat, because the idea of it finally being over is so comforting. I'm afraid to drive, because I'll give into temptations. I'm just so tired of trying.

I also think I'm constantly making up excuses because even though I think I need help I don't really want it. I'm just shutting down to everyone. 

So how does someone go about self admitting? And if I can't get myself to do this, is there a way I can get someone or something to force me to do it?",1,ive struggled mental illness basically entire life ive therapy decades recently occurred actually cant remember feels depressed case dissociatiated time hospitalized 14 15 16 weird sorta half school half mental hospital clinic place im sure im worried lose job im shape actually contact figure paperwork time spent 45 minutes picking putting knife debating want feel cant eat idea finally comforting im afraid drive ill temptations im tired trying think im constantly making ecuses think need help dont want im shutting self admitting cant way force
3168,"I'm currently sitting in a dominos waiting for a $5 pizza that will probably give me food poisoning. I've been effectively jobless for a year. Picked up a job every now and then the longest which lasted two weeks before I got anxious and quit. 

I recently got a really great offer for a job, $30 AUD per hour, 40 hours a week. I went the first day, found out my manager got fired. Found out I was meant to have experience even though my resume didn't have any. Got paranoid and sent some emails saying I was quitting. They rejected a recent timesheet so I thought they were trying not to pay me. I sent some really nasty emails threatening to go to the Fair Work Ombudsman. Turns out I fucked up the time sheet, probably made the poor woman of a small business incredibly stressed. Insulted the management of the company. 

Me and my boyfriend had an argument that night over something really small that I had an issue with. He became suicidal and self-harming. Needed help from his nan and a roommate to help him. I couldn't help him. He didn't want me anywhere near him. Got him some vallium to get him to sleep. It worked thankfully and knocked him out. 

A person I looked up to is very disappointed in me for losing my job I just got. I can't seem to keep them because of my fluctuating paranoia and stupid feelings.

This doesn't seem to get better. I was always told I had a lot of potential, always performed well in school despite being a little shit. Try really hard when I am working. I just can't handle rejection (perceived or otherwise), basically any criticism at my job or it instantly kills my motivation and I can't think of anything else the entire shift.

I’m on the highest dose of Zoloft and guys it stopped working. It worked for a little bit when I struggled with Postpartum depression at the beginning of the year. But it’s been 8 months and I’ve been increased to the highest dose and I literally feel nothing. 

So today, I sat back and did a lot of thinking, walking down each path I’ve ever took in my life. I’m about to be 24, and I literally just tried to find the root of the problem for myself. I tried to figure out where exactly everything changed and where I went wrong. So after questioning my existence, my abilities, my own decisions, my perspective, my reasoning for any dumb thing I’ve ever done, the only thing I have resulted to is that somewhere along the way I became completely damaged and even I don’t know when exactly it changed me mentally because there are SO many bad paths I’ve been down. 

Ive laid here in my bed all day today just trying to escape my own mind by trying to just sleep. Idk anymore. I don’t know why i am the way I am. I don’t even like talking about it.

Today was the straw that broke the camels back……
So I don’t know if it sounds “needy” of me but at this point I don’t give two craps.
I felt like my best friend for 5 years that I could tell anything to would always be by my side.
But stuff happened, he got into drugs like weed and crap…..to “self medicate” 
Me I’ve never done anything, I get sick to the bone when I see or hear drugs, I’ve had two family members die due to drug issues….so I’m pretty hesitant to stay far away from them.
So as he started to do more he started to become a crappy friend, would listen but not care.
Would thankfully accept the gifts but not give me the light of day to talk to me when I had a gun to my head because he was “tired”
But recently he got caught smoking weed while I was over at his house (mind you I’m 16 so we obviously still live at our parents)
But his mum got mad blamed me and kicked me out.
(She only blames me because I live in a poor neighborhood no joke)
So over summer brake I’ve tried many times to try and hang out….he gave an excuse “oh my mom won’t let anyone over” 
But then came July…my one year anniversary of being admitted to a mental hospital….asked him a week before if I could come over on my anniversary, he said sure..
So the week of it I asked…he said we was at another friends house.
(This friend is the one that’s selling him drugs, he was doing drugs at his house that’s the only reason why I couldn’t come over)

Same thing today, asked if he wanted to come over and he told me that he doesn’t know if his mom would let him….didn’t even try to ask.
So I feel like he doesn’t give two shits about me, I feel like all he cares about is just doing weed.
And the bad thing is that he’s pretty much my whole reason of living…but now I feel like this friendship won’t last very long…and we’ll he’s literally the only friend I have…

I’m tired of his mom always blaming me when his drug test comes back positive.
I just want to tell her “then test me, it’s gonna come back negative, but test his friend and it’s gonna come back positive because that’s where he gets the drugs, so don’t judge people for what you can’t see.
Because just because I’m poorer then dirt doesn’t mean I’m a drug dealer”
But idk I don’t wanna make things worse.

Sorry if it’s hard to understand, I have a flood in my mind, I don’t know what’s gonnna happen.

3222,"I think I just made suicidal gesture?Okay, 

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",1,think suicidal gestureokay im grad school sucks im idea going academia dont want love discipline lets real going said cant stand peers faculty feel like idiot time ecited prospect taking given cost got language program great financially speaking cant afford support summer outside loans im shoe string budget ruin little money left tell adviser tells words dont degrees adviser absent degree process hearing disillusioning clue dont want degrees hate program stay ill miserable got ill hate quitting know thinking transferring grad school easier said night got big argument parents wasnt decision going fact need lighten fuck responsibility hours later got studying upset thinking irreparable mess situation way took belt fastened neck tied rack closet high ground hang sat considered tightening belt try cut circulation head didnt think work chickened dont know took went bed guess question suicidal gesture dont want parents worry mei dont want deal embarassment potential fallout telling situation dont think brush rug

I can maintain my part time job, and fake smile to my kids and strangers because I have to, and I don't want to get anyone down if they were to really know how far in despair I am.

But once the kids are in bed I'm so exhausted from pretending all day, I just lay in bed either drinking because I need to quiet my thoughts, or when I can fight the drinking I'm stuck in my own head imagining the best way to commit suicide. By now I've written each of my children a letter, and last night I wrote my husband a letter. That was the last suicide note I still needed to write.

I’ve cut myself, I’ve tried to hang myself, and I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’ve almost stabbed someone intentionally. I have intense anxiety, and I’ve missed maybe 7 months of school last year because of it.

I’m afraid of the dark, I like horror flicks and books but they give me nightmares. I like to write, draw, play videogames, and exercise. I really love my 2 dogs. I love my dad and I just texted him for the first time in maybe 2 months. He has tried his best and I’m about to (maybe) throw it all away. 

I can’t go on like this.

So either I change, or end it.

So I’m a 30 year old male and I was diagnosed with clinical depression at age 12. In my pre teen and early teen years I was medicated with Wellbutrin and it was nominally effective. But after I was weened off of it around age 16 I haven’t been medicated again. 

My depression came back with a vengeance around age 17 and since then I have self medicated with cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco (I’m a grown man please don’t lecture me about that part I’m fully aware). It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that I decided to seek professional help and begin treatment of some kind. At that time I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. My doctor decided to tackle the anxiety first, because it is a contributing factor to depression. I’ve been taking Buspar and Propranolol for three months now and it has been noticeably effective at combating my severe anxiety. However, it hasn’t helped my mood and my doctor agreed with my request to try Effexor. 

My question is this- have you tried it? What was your experience? 

I am married to a woman with a very high sex drive and I am concerned about the impact Effexor may have on my libido (and thus our relationship). Have you dealt with this issue?

I suppose it all has an element of truth, but that doesn’t help erase the feelings of weakness and ineptitude. I just can’t pull myself up by the bootstraps and snap myself out of it.

3355,"  Growing up I watched my mom go from having a successful life/career (all while being a single mother) to eventually passing away from her drug addiction just a few months ago. In the years that my mom's addiction got worse I began to isolate myself from friends and family. Living from house to house and hardly having enough money to get by made it hard to make good friends. I envied kids who had ""normal"" lives, most of their problems seemed like blessings to me. 

  Now I'm 22 and I don't have any friends I talk to even just to chat online. I try to make a bond with my family but half of them treat me like I'm already a drug addict and the other half I can't recognize from being so withdrawn for so long which just makes me fell like an outsider. My mom was the only person I've ever felt unconditional love from, and in the years leading up to her death, I pushed her away too. Everyone else in my family had just given up hope of her ever getting help. So after years of doing everything i could, i gave up too. I couldn't keep watching her put herself through hell and back again and again. Now that she's gone I feel nothing but emptiness.

I try letting my friends in, and end up pushing away everyone and the one person I had to talk to about this stuff even got sick of me and has barely talked to me for 2 months. I've tried making new ones but I'm so depressing and emotionless and hard to be around that I can't even do that well. People get so sick of me that they don't want to be around me anymore. Combine that with the crippling anxiety. Not social anxiety but just general anxiety over the dumbest things.

Therapy is too expensive, probably even for my parents. I don't want to be pills or anti depressants. These stupid hotlines, and ""crisis text lines"" are all scams and automated messages from reviews I've been reading and will in fact call the police on you.

Recently I've tried to find hotlines and text lines and even then these hotlines and text lines are about as useful as a school counselor, whose honestly only purpose is to ""get you back on the right track so they can talk to you more about college"" Trust me I've tried starting some conversation with them. 

So what do I even do? I'm dying on the inside and outside. Sleep schedule fucked, I'm underweight and barely can get myself to even eat the 2 meals a day I do have. All I do is pointlessly edit shit for my small ass youtube channel which is the only thing that probably keeps me sane when I'm barely even allowed outside, I'm allowed to sleep for most of the entire day though without anyone stopping me or waking me up, I have no responsibilities, no actual life skills or any sort of reasonable or useful skill.

3375,"I just called a crysis hotline, what a waste of time and tearsI don't want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare.

so ya don't wreck my life and find out who i am. 

I just called a crysis hotline, and it was busy, lol and I called 5 more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times. then I found another line for some local crysis centre.

i used to work as a telephone surveyer, it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone, just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell. special one time offer! how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you.

actually that sounds terrible, I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can't see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem. so basically I am alone, I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares.

it's all up to you she says, wow what a thing to say to someone with depression, yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me, i know that my life is either shitty or it isn't based off my actions. I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn't blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I'm just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.

it's like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that's not gonna work, and I don't have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that's not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm

so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don't mind my job, I actually like it there, it's the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it's not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it's just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don't I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn't work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I've maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn't even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.

so now I'm stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I'm not even hopelessly in debt, I just can't leave here, but I can't live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don't even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don't even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me

so ya whatever I guess, I'm taking some art classes, and I found out I'm very talented, lol I'm a very honest person in a way that's great on camera. But I'm fat and people don't have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too

but ya I can't fix it. I know people won't accept this statement, but when I'm on my ""healthy diet"" I feel great and am not hungry because it's well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it's just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don't care because I think I've already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don't feel bad.

and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won't seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don't want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that's 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I'm like 2000 calories over my needs and then that's evey day, and that's like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don't care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.

 it's just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we're in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don't hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it's not because you hate me, it's because I love(yes I know I don't know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you'll regect me and it's easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn't and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it's just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn't time to get desperate and you just say ""I'm gonna play it cool and later maybe do something."" and then you get home and you remember, I'm almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she'll regect you like everyone else because you've done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you've played it out like groundhogs day, where you've done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.

you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I'm actually in pretty good shape, I'm just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it's really hard being so fat). and I got down to I'm 6'2 220 which the lightest I've been in ever,  even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I've been under 30bmi since I've remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I've thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an  issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it's like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn't take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn't one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.

so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I'm not tryhing to violate the rules,  it's just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I'm really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can't ask and don't have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don't like having to hear myself, crying wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to hear the whale, it's like someone else, it's like I'm hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me.  I'm just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don't interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.

and all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it'll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I'll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I'll be happy, that's what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible.",1,called crisis hotline waste time tears dont want new reddit account tried time wanted post ended locked

3386,"*Excuse me for the grammar, I am not English.*

&#x200B;

I lived a ""beautiful"" life until now, I went to primary school in a small school in the village I live, I had a lot of fun and almost everyone in the school was my friends, then I had to go to the city for the secondary years and I realised how the world was very different than my small beautiful village plus almost all my old friends went to others school than me. But then again, I happened to make new friends who are great, I still meet them often and even if one of them died in a car accident, we are still a unite group, we even went together to his grave and bring some flowers.

Concerning grades school, everything is ok, I am able to study, even though I don't really like that, like a lot of people I guess. 

My parents aren't really strict, they just want me to do ""something"", they don't really care what, they even accept to pay the academic year and even though I don't know what I'm gonna do, which make me stress a lot, I am happy.

Or at least I should be, I live in a beautiful house in a wonderful village, I have a great family, I have some good friends and yet... I am far of being happy. First, I hate my family, I know that it seems strange since I said that they were great but... only on the surface. They always bring my mistakes and indecisions as jokes on the public conversations, may sound like they are worried about me and my future (which make me worried too) but it's juste to avoid the criticism of others about the fact that I'm the ""failed"" one. My 2 brothers succeed everything in life, they knew what they wanted to do from the very beginning and passed without real struggles and then there is me...

But if it was just that... Everytime I hang out with firends I just don't want to leave them, when I need to go to the bathroom, I feel like they are far from me and that I miss them even though I prefer being alone most of the time, lockdown didn't make me really suffer and I even have to say that I enjoyed it.

And now, I just feel the void inside me, I lived and I live the ""perfect"" life and yet, it didn't bring me anything spiritually talking, in the end it's a game who brought me my spiritual consciousness.I don't know if I have to thanks Persona 3 or curse it.

I want to live a simple life and yet I have the feeling that it's impossible, everything seems so difficult, so insurmountable and my parents keep putting pressure on me, telling me to choose even though I keep repeating that I don't know what to do and every day I know that I am approaching the moment my parents will tell me to go out, that they don't want someone who do nothing in their house.

in the end I am wondering if suicide is not best option, of course it will make my family and friends cry but I don't care, this feeling of emptiness is so strong. What is the point in leaving only for the sake of others? Does life need to be spend in fear and emptiness, just for some others humans, even though you love them?",1,ecuse grammar english #200b lived beautiful life went primary school small school village live lot fun school friends city secondary years realised world different small beautiful village plus old friends went school happened new friends great meet died car accident unite group went grave bring flowers concerning grades school ok able study dont like like lot people guess parents arent strict want dont care accept pay academic year dont know im gonna stress lot happy live beautiful house wonderful village great family good friends far happy hate family know strange said great surface bring mistakes indecisions jokes public conversations sound like worried future worried juste avoid criticism fact im failed 2 brothers succeed life knew wanted beginning passed real struggles everytime hang firends dont want leave need bathroom feel like far miss prefer time lockdown didnt suffer enjoyed feel void inside lived live perfect life didnt bring spiritually talking end game brought spiritual consciousness dont know thanks persona 3 curse want live simple life feeling impossible difficult insurmountable parents putting pressure telling choose repeating dont know day know approaching moment parents tell dont want house end wondering suicide best option course family friends cry dont care feeling emptiness strong point leaving sake life need spend fear emptiness humans love

3409,"Ideation ended up in making a noose tonight.Or trying too. Or experimenting with putting the belt around the shower rail. Even though I had no real intention of killing myself, I did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped I’d slip and accidentally end up hanging myself.

I feel like I’m too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when I’m scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because I’m too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts I’d got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know it’s basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just can’t help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesn’t matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I don’t feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits weren’t enough and I feel like I’m just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From ‘soulmate’ to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like I’m too sensitive for a man, and that I’m not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. I’m 31 but I feel like I’ve been struggling for so long.",1,ideation ended making noose tonightor trying eperimenting putting belt shower rail real intention killing head let choke bit possibly hoped id slip accidentally end hanging feel like im sensitive world sensitivity seen negativity care people attached im scared lose end pushing away im intense wanting let know valued recently friend work admitted having feelings drunk night good friend month ago telling thoughtful gifts id got wants know basically sent way intense tet wanting retain friendship pattern develop great friendships close ruin best friend kissed colleagues try rein cant help lady genuinely felt flirted feel stupid misreading signs getting touchy feely bit end patting butt joking workhusband single happens feel erases positive things thought mistake end losing doesnt matter funny found thoughtful thought end ruin dont feel offer positive traits werent feel like im good fundamentally wrong e told loved spent week holiday cried 2 hours getting homesickness 2 weeks looking dumped got soulmate dumping 10 days pretty looked cancelled trip early home planned year spent lot money feel like im sensitive man im attractive offer long relationship close friendship sensitive care people hurt leave tired im 31 feel like ive struggling long

3430,"Hi. Whats happened? Things have spiralled really fast. They always do. I knew a week or two ago that I needed to nip it in the bud. I let it draw me in again like Lust. It confuses me so much. 
I need to remember that ultimately I'm not allowed to die so I need to get off the train. 
It's weird that relationship within myself, doctor and patient, oppressor and oppressed, victim and perpetrator. Which side do I identify with the most?
I guess the active, caring, violent side is the drive and desire for better, its just misdirected. The victim, injured side is never where I fully lie either, because I am never one without the other. It's the contrast between the two which makes it so satisfying. And dirty. And confusing.
It clouds how I see my day, and I want to destroy. I get triggered when I am with other people and I am near blades or burning hot metal; I want to hurt myself in secret, in plain sight.
It forces me to lie. Pretend. Because its too awkward and embarrassing for other people to know whilst it's still right here, in control of my body and my mind. I don't care if people know about the past because it's not happening and I can own it. But whilst it's here, the other people become active members in it's presence and I dont understand it myself, so I'm not ready for other people's help.
I tell myself that people don't want to hear about how you want to hurt yourself. It almost insults them because they are a part of the world that is inadequate in the first place. In addition, it would insult them more that their advice and best intentions may not, probably help.

But at the same non-sensical time, speaking out allows me to own it, like I do the past depression, it allows me to have a voice against this parasite which has taken over. My logical conclusions say it shouldnt help. [Which side is my logic on?] -But it does help, should I have the courage to speak out against its rule.
However. I cannot remain on both trains, they have contrasting directions.
Duality. Again.

I cannot lie in submission, hot waves of throbbing information coursing through my blood, whilst also standing up tall and confident and LOUD.
I cannot read and write the narrative of dry misery and ugliness, whilst also reading and writing the lifefull, endless potential of my future. The trains have very different destinations. 

Am I destined to flicker from one train to the other?

3442,"Do any of you fellow depression-firsthand-specialists ever get to a point where you stop caring about the problems of those around you. And by this i don't mean in a negative way where you emotionally unload on others and engage in self-centered behaviors. I mean just full on still trying your best to support others but not having the energy to care. I know spouts of irritability is typical for this flavor of mental illness, yet it feels as though the more people around me bring up their problems that a) they either created themselves or b) don't take any of my suggestions for solutions that will help them or c) just straight up keep ranting about but won't do anything to change. It gets tiring listening to people all the time. As an emotional support eldest daughter that was heavily parentified and only found out about it in her teen years, i've realized I overextend myself to others. I grew up forced to become a compulsive caretaker, physically and emotionally caring for my sisters and mom when my mom couldn't because of the various problems in her life. I love my mom and would go to the ends of the earth for her, but i can't deny the part of me that resents her for this. 

More specifically with me overextending myself, I always give 110% to my friends when i'm almost always at 20% mentally. I know i need to take some responsibility in this because i need to strengthen my boundaries, but at the same time even with my friends who have mental illness issues, I don't feel like they understand that i don't have authentic energy to give them right now. It always comes off as me being flakey but really it's just hard for me to talk to people on the phone when physically i feel like i want to go to sleep but can't. Even when depression and anxiety tells me i shouldn't go out for the day, I still go to hang out with me. Even when my social battery is dead, I still go out of my way for them. This isn't to say they don't support me, because I am lucky to have good friends. I'm just realizing I give too much to them and not enough to myself. 

Two sort of friendships made me realize i over extend myself. recently a friend of mine who routinely emotionally dumps on me contacted me and essentially said we don't feel as close as we used to. In all honestly to me them saying that feels a bit dramatic. I'm away right now and not any where near them. I made it clear I wouldn't be back for a while and even told them when i would be so we could hang out. They kept asking when i would be home and have even made passive aggressive comment once about us not hanging out. Every time we do hang out this person emotionally unloads on me and doesn't respect my time often overstaying their welcome when i tried to make it clear before that I had other things i needed to do that day. They also do a lot of manipulative things like try to appeal to my emotions with what they are going through and putting me in and awkward position when i have to tell them no because of the things I'm personally going through. I feel bad for them, because they are genuinely going through some terrible things, but at the same time half of their problems are problems they create themselves by continuing relationships with people they know are toxic, or blatantly acknowledging then ignoring red flags. I don't have a problem with them, I do still care about them, but i'm over their complaining. It's draining. 

My ex-roommate is very similar to this person. They often unloaded on me emotionally, was extremely passive aggressive, and mean whenever something in their life wasn't going their way. I don't remember one time where they've supported me or listened to my issues without turning it back to their problems. Most of these problems involve their past and ptsd experiences, which as someone who suffers from deep childhood trauma, i understand how things can trigger and set you off. However, I quickly grew tired of them going on and on about their past and how terrible people were to them when they were in the present being an asshole to me. I was too understanding and i'm still trying to forgive myself for that. I too often vented about this person but rarely confronted them about their actions. I didn't want to make things worse for them. I knew they were like this when i first met them and as a result distanced myself and took to be their acquaintance. It was harder to avoid their shitty tendencies when we became roommates. Tbh i've never met anyone so entitled and so incapable of handling emotions. They are very emotionally immature. I believe this is a result of their parents stepping in to take care of them every time the slightest thing goes wrong. They put up a façade of wanting to be independent and complain about their parents, yet aren't doing the work to be so. In fact, I'm convinced they only started being independent because their parents disprove of them living with their significant other and threatened to no longer support them financially. apart of me feels bad for disliking this person as much as I do (the people pleasing part), the human me who doesn't strive to be perfect and kind all the time acknowledges that some people suck and that person lowkey is one of them. 

In both situations i distanced myself, of course having decent interactions with both of them every once in a while, but realizing they both drain my emotional energy, i put up a wall to not deal with them. I don't hate my ex- roommate, I could get along with them in a group setting where i don't actually have to talk to them. At the end of the day I know how my friends are and it isn't them. 

I have a childhood friend that i haven't seen in about a year due to the pandemic. We still keep in contact here and there. But i miss them so much. Apart of me feels as though college and the pandemic have made us drift apart. It makes me so sad. Especially when i've realized most of the time they come to me only when they need help on papers. My other friend rarely talks to me anymore, she has a boyfriend now and from what i've heard spends most of her time with her. I love them dearly, but i'm scared that i don't have a place in their life anymore. I'm scared they won't have me in their big life moments because its been so long. 

I'm at a period in my life where everything feels so hard. I have a damn good life, because of what my mom instilled in me growing up and a combination of my resilience and hard work. I am where i want to be in life situationally, but not mentally. I feel so tired, so unheard, so broken. I have no hope right now. I reach out to my god and religion often, praying and trying my best to work on myself but I'm so tired. It's hard for me to feel motivated nowadays. Its hard for me to care about others problems.

3500,"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. 

I was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. 

Full disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.

My parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).

Also of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. 

These last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.

I just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.

The only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.

I know this all may seem quite pathetic and obvious in terms of an answer to you guys, but I just had to get this out. I still feel godawful at the moment but better than when I started.

3501,"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed. 

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard. 

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home. 

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm. 

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course. 

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt. 

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop. 

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary. 

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding. 

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end. 

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working.

3503,"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 

However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 

Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.

The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.

When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.

I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?

If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.

TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

3521,"Hi,

I've been a bit lost in life I admit since graduating college almost 5 years ago, but a few years ago I realized what used to be fun no longer is. I used to play video games with my friends and still do but feel no joy, I only do it to be able to speak with them. I started baking but I realize I do it to get my mind off things it's not fun it's an accomplishment possibly. 

I started Therapy January 2020 and brought this up with my Therapist that I can't find anything that is fun a few months ago but they didn't say much to my statements and we moved on. I do have anxiety however, right now it's actually much lower than it's ever been. Before they left for vacation almost a month ago they said I have the positive and negative of too much time as I work part time. 

I'm really lost in life right now and was working with a Career Coach and one of the final questions was again something similar if money, expenses didn't matter what would I do for fun. I sat for hours until 2 am thinking and couldn't come up with anything.

The world in general I realize I feel a bit lost, each suburb seems the same and the city raises my anxiety. I don't know where I belong or what to do. There's just wondering what to do and no time for fun or I can't figure out what is/ would be fun. Long walks are relaxing but not fun.

Is this maybe just a phase while I try to get a sense of direction in life? Then things will start showing up that seem fun? If everyday feels the same and the days blend into each other how do you take time off for fun?",1,ive bit lost life admit graduating college 5 years ago years ago realized fun longer play video games friends feel joy able speak started baking realize mind things fun accomplishment possibly started therapy january 2020 brought therapist cant find fun months ago didnt statements moved aniety right actually lower left vacation month ago said positive negative time work time im lost life right working career coach final questions similar money epenses didnt matter fun sat hours 2 thinking couldnt come world general realize feel bit lost suburb city raises aniety dont know belong theres wondering time fun cant figure fun long walks relaing fun maybe phase try sense direction life things start showing fun everyday feels days blend time fun

3582,"Will someone please talk me down..

I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 

Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.

 Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death. Can someone please talk to me and help me through this before I make a very bad decision??",1,talk posted couple days ago posted sub little response female midthirties severely chronically ill physically disabled unable drive work condition physically impossible live awful divorces currently trapped abusive engagement guy strong reasons believe unfaithful narcissist despite negative panel sad test results continued si months counting eperience terrible uneplainable symptoms appear align stop dont want right suspicions entire life rests partner shouldnt literally friends family turn help betrayed absolutely use facebook lived mother couple years huge mistake confiding mother partners sister fears beginning tip partner suspicions abused trapped knows mean freaking terrified finds dont trust convinced retested early net months future rides results stay mother passed away terrible illness month ago father staying simply question entirely going shelter impossible physically disabled person considered liability eperience turned away past absolutely recourse situation absolutely terrified completely freaking oh god way death talk help bad decision

3611,"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.
Also, in case someone was wondering why I don't go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it's because my ex is literally the only friend I have.

Like they're so pretty and I wish I could be confident and body positive about myself but when I see these women all I can think is how I'm nothing like them. How I'm disgusting and no matter how hard I try nothing works.

I've been trying to lose weight for months now. I eat healthy, make home cooked meals, go for regular walks and runs and I roller skate. But nothing changed. I haven't lost anything. Once my scales messed up making me think I'd lost quite a bit and I was so happy. I felt so proud. But then when I realised how they'd messed up. I really wanted to die. I felt like such an idiot. I am an idiot. I just want to be happy in myself. I want to walk into a room and not feel like I'm taking up space. I literally can't stop sobbing right now.

I need to ask my doctor to up my meds but I'm too scared. Maybe this isn't even depression maybe this is just how I'm meant to feel. I just. I hate this. I don't like a single thing about me.

3734,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually leads disappointment disaster usually works differently anytime casual social contet huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship support flag inappropriate content know struggling hard work scenes information resources easier quality help small start new wiki page eplains detail better respond public comments youve gotten know maintained r depression wiki private_contact tet current version ###summary### acting helper invites accepts private contact ie past chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing bad intentions bad judgement way unwise trust anytime like kind generous offer perfectly wellmeaning solid rapport established wise idea points consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive replies publicly youll help people op responses good quality youll educate inspire helpers 1990 rule https enwikipediaorg wiki 125_rule_ internet_culture applies internet people struggling mentalhealth issues justifiably low tolerance disappointment highlevel everchanging emotional need helper able 100 commitment way long necessary offering personal inbo resource likely harm good mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont names callers arent allowed request specific responders healthier safer callers develop relationship agency analogously safer healthier ops develop relationship community trained responders generally allowed work highintensity situations partly availability wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper gets head mentalhealth issues including suicidality morbid depression escalated conversation harder including r depression r suicidewatch moderators help contrary common assumptions moderators cant police pms observation years people consistently ones understanding mentalhealth issues mentalhealth support gaps knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitations theres reason whos truly help want hide responses community scrutiny helpers concerned privacy mind selfdisclosure supportively feelings details problem use alt throwaway accounts restrictions account age karma know internet people eploit abuse people want hide deceptive manipulative responses ecept victims specifically target vulnerable mentalhealth issues helper invites op talk privately gives good supportive eperience theyve primed person vulnerable abusers sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someones state mentalhealth crisis people rely heuristics critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit best option dont recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want epectations realistic careful look history offers opening

3815,"And here I am once again.Back to feeling extremely suicidal again. I made a post in /r/depression a few days ago, hoping I wouldn't get this suicidal again. I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago (not in a way I had to see a hospital) and I never told anyone in real life about it. 
My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.

I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.
Knowing that nobody else can give me this kind of support. Knowing that this post and all the replies won't make me feel any better. It just seems impossible.",1,againback feeling etremely suicidal post r depression days ago hoping wouldnt suicidal tried kill weeks ago way hospital told real life family knows im depressed wish help mother tried hard feel little better doesnt work repressed memories im sick basically stuck bed cant things school job im im people im lonely dating guy like left better thought dragging feel better miss lot 6 months feel way im tired people telling telling find better wont felt attracted life ecept didnt leave didnt love anymore usual breakup reason cant forget breakup loneliness combined problems things getting worse day day feel lonely wish needed cant cant knowing kind support knowing post replies wont feel better impossible

3821,"Here. Imma paste a wall of text that I typed elsewhere and try to make some slight edits.


I was admitted to the mental health unit Wednesday night. Dr Santin met with me on Thursday morning. We talked about what meds I’m on. He remarked that I’m on a lot of meds. This is true. He wanted to reduce them. This sounds like a bad idea. He talked about my steroids and pain management meds.


I had to give him a talk on adrenal insufficiency. What it is, how it works, how it is treated. 

[adrenal insufficiency is when your adrenal glands don’t make cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone and it is crucial to life. If you do not make cortisol, you have to replace it with steroids.  Now I am steroid-dependent]

While I was talking to him, I did mention that I had changed endocrinologists. That’s why my steroid dosage was slightly different from what was in the system. That was what the old Endo had me on (for the record, I went from 10/5 to 10/5/2.5 a day). 

I really didn’t think much of the conversation. I didn’t test him afterward to make sure he had a basic understanding. I just assumed that if he had any relevant questions he would ask. He didn’t ask me anything and we moved on to my autism diagnosis. He told me that i do not have autism and I have BPD. I explained to him that autism is not a subjective observation, but rather an objective diagnosis and that I was diagnosed by Dr M, PhD.  He argued with me at length.

So later that day they ask me to sign a form authorizing contact with my Endocrinologist. Only it says “OldEndoFirst NewEndoLast.”  So I correct the nurse. I explain that Dr J is my old doctor and Dr B is my current provider. She fills out a new form with my correct Endo on it. 

The next day I did not meet with the psych. I met with Mary, PA. She informed me that we were going to be titrating down on the steroids. I said no. She told me that Dr Santin consulted with the internal medicine provider at the hospital who said it was appropriate. I told her no. I said he needed to consult with an endocrinologist. She then backtracked to say that my Endo had been called and was on board with this.  She also mentioned something about Dr Staub. I don’t know who that is. 

I called Dr B. It was about 3 pm on a Friday. I explained to the nurse that they were trying to titrate me down and I needed my doc to call the hospital. Gave her the unit that I was on, number to the nursing station, name of the doctor and PA. They said they’d call me back. I was doubtful because it was 3 pm. They didn’t call me. 

Saturday morning I met with an Judy, APRN. She didn’t even bother to pretend she had my records on the screen in front of her. She has this notebook. She informed me that I was not steroid-dependent and I didn’t need steroids so they were going to taper me off of them. I told her that I am steroid dependent, that I was diagnosed in that very hospital back in January and have been following with an Endo ever since. They gave me 7.5 mg that morning instead of 10 mg to start the tapering. 

So I kicked up a fuss. I called my friend who works at that hospital. I asked her what to do. On Friday at 2 pm I had tried to sign out AMA and as a result was put on a 48-hour psychiatric hold. Meaning I couldn’t leave until 2 pm Sunday. So my friend told me to 1. Find out which internal medicine doc was consulted 2. Get a patient advocate and 3. File a grievance. She also told me that Dr M, who diagnosed me with AI, happened to be on duty at the time. 

I went to the nurses station and asked for the patient advocate. They instead called the nursing manager. While I was waiting for him, Judy met with me again. I told her the name of the doc who diagnosed me. I told her he is working right now. She got really pissed and demanded to know how I knew that. She did not contact him. 

The nursing manager told me that if I signed out AMA they would be required to call the police for a welfare check and that if the police thought I was a danger I could be locked up in the crisis center for 48 hours. I told him I’d roll the dice. 

Judy came in again and told me how being on steroids was bad for me and they were doing this to help me. By then I had been under-dosed and over-stressed and could barely stay upright. I demanded to go home. They eventually said they’d get my paperwork started. Five hours later I got home. 

So now I am supposed to get a call from a patient advocate tomorrow. I plan on raising hell. I’ve looked through my chart. For one, not everything that should be in there is in there. Either it’s restricted so I can’t see it, or the doctor just didn’t bother to document his time with me. 

They replaced my AI diagnosis with “factitious disorder imposed on self.”  It notes that I am claiming to have Addison’s disease (I always said adrenal insufficiency) and that I choose to take steroids and increase my dose by myself because it makes me feel good. It says that they contacted some random pain specialist I’ve never heard of about my steroid use.  Somehow Dr Santin thinks I was using steroids to treat my pain. Apparently they may have called my old Endo, Dr J, as well. 

I called new Endo on Monday morning. They had no record of ever being contacted by the hospital. 

And for the record, “factitious disorder imposed on self” is another name for Munchausens Syndrome. 

I have removed names, but left in Dr Santin because he deserves to be called out in public forums whenever possible. He nearly caused me serious harm. And he never did treat my depression. I left far worse than when I checked in.",1,imma paste wall tet typed try slight edits admitted mental health unit wednesday night satin met thursday morning talked meds im remarked im lot meds true wanted reduce sounds like bad idea talked steroids pain management meds talk adrenal insufficiency works treated adrenal insufficiency adrenal glands dont cortisol cortisol stress hormone crucial life cortisol replace steroids steroiddependent talking mention changed endocrinologist thats steroid dosage slightly different system old endo record went 10 5 10 5 25 day didnt think conversation didnt test afterward sure basic understanding assumed relevant questions ask didnt ask moved autism diagnosis told autism bad eplained autism subjective observation objective diagnosis diagnosed pod argued length later day ask sign form authorizing contact endocrinologist says oldendofirst newendolast correct nurse eplain old doctor current provider fills new form correct endo net day meet psycho met mary pay informed going titrating steroids said told satin consulted internal medicine provider hospital said appropriate told said needed consult endocrinologist backtracked endo called board mentioned stab dont know called 3 friday eplained nurse trying titrate needed doc hospital gave unit number nursing station doctor pay said theyd doubtful 3 didnt saturday morning met judy apron didnt bother pretend records screen notebook informed steroiddependent didnt need steroids going taper told steroid dependent diagnosed hospital january following endo gave 75 morning instead 10 start tapering kicked fuss called friend works hospital asked friday 2 tried sign ama result 48hour psychiatric hold meaning couldnt leave 2 sunday friend told 1 find internal medicine doc consulted 2 patient advocate 3 file grievance told diagnosed air happened duty time went nurses station asked patient advocate instead called nursing manager waiting judy met told doc diagnosed told working right got pissed demanded know knew contact nursing manager told signed ama required police welfare check police thought danger locked crisis center 48 hours told id roll dice judy came told steroids bad help underdosed overstressed barely stay upright demanded home eventually said theyd paperwork started hours later got home supposed patient advocate tomorrow plan raising hell ive looked chart restricted cant doctor didnt bother document time replaced ai diagnosis factitious disorder imposed self notes claiming addisons disease said adrenal insufficiency choose steroids increase dose makes feel good says contacted random pain specialist ive heard steroid satin thinks steroids treat pain apparently called old endow je called new endo monday morning record contacted hospital record factitious disorder imposed self munchausen syndrome removed names left satin deserves called public forums possible nearly caused harm treat depression left far worse checked

Sometimes it feels physically impossible to feel anything other than despair. When I try to think of why I’m sad I just hit a wall of thoughts all screaming over one another all the horrible reasons why I feel so bad. How am I supposed to be positive? 

It’s like telling someone who’s been starving their whole lives, to just be full. To just ignore the rumbles they will go away, but they offer no food, not real substance.

I hate when they tell me I have to rely on myself for happiness. I’ve never felt it on my own. I don’t want it that way. I just want to feel cared about and understood. Then at least I’d have some support to fall back on when it’s hard. But it’s always hard, it never lets up it just gets harder and harder to have hope for the future and to keep fighting; for what? 

It’s too much to think about most of the time, I just turned 21 a couple days ago and the whole day I was thinking I could just enjoy that day and end it to save myself from more pain.

I'm a 28F who has recently been seeking treatment for major depression, anxiety, OCD and a few other symptoms of trauma. 

Throughout most of my childhood, my mother had on-and-off episodes of rage. She would take her anger out on whoever was in her way no matter the cause of her outburst. 

I've grown up learning how to listen for footsteps or a change in voice tone. I can honestly say that my mother is the only one in my family to instill true fear in me. 

She was never physically abusive (at least not that I can remember), but she was always capable of saying hurtful things to my dad, my siblings, and me. 

I grew up watching my mom bully my older sister and allow others (including myself) to bully her as well. Even though I always thought it was in good spirit, I felt terribly for her. She now struggles with depression/anxiety but will always cater to our mom in order to avoid another angry episode. 

I always felt responsible for my mother's emotions, and it's now clear to me that she still has this same control over my father. I don't even want to get into how cruel she can be towards him. 

Despite all this, she is a great mother who was always loving to us. She never made me feel like she wasn't there for me, but at this point in my life I feel like I can't connect with her. If she's in the wrong mood, she will invalidate my personal struggles and throw the ""ungrateful"" card at me. 

I always trusted her and believed she understood me, but I can't believe that anymore.",1,im scared post im afraid coming like spoiled brat im recently seeking treatment major depression aniety ocd symptoms trauma childhood mother onandoff episodes rage anger way matter cause outburst ive grown learning listen footsteps change voice tone honestly mother family instill true fear physically abusive remember capable saying hurtful things dad siblings grew watching mom bully older sister allow including bully thought good spirit felt terribly struggles depression aniety cater mom order avoid angry episode felt responsible mothers emotions clear control father dont want cruel despite great mother loving feel like wasnt point life feel like cant connect shes wrong mood invalidate personal struggles throw ungrateful card trusted believed understood cant believe anymore

3887,"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable.

They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now I’m just annoying to them. I’ve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (I’m talking fucking years dude) and I’m experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I can’t hold down a job, I’m living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isn’t helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. I’m terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I can’t feel anything. I’m either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. I’m back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing I’ve been looking forward to for months, the only thing I’ve been trying to live for I can’t go to anymore. I’m a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. I’m better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. I’d been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had weren’t right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldn’t take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so I’m just alone. They won’t even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again. 

I feel like I’ve regressed back into a teenager. I would have been committed if my boyfriend didn’t take a fifty dollar Uber to get to me and stop the whole thing from happening.

Not like these days where it's more recognized and not as stigmatized.

I guess I never really grasped how depressed I was til everything because extraordinarily exhausting, just responding to a text is an effort I don't have the energy for and every day is a the same. Days off sometimes even when I wake up early I will lie in bed til I am forced to get up and carry out a semblance of a day. It's not one off either, it's every day off. My work causes me so much stress and anxiety that it's almost choking at times. Nothing is really bad it's everything is bad, it's just everything is exhausting and if it's not exhausting it's annoying. 

Anyways I am not looking for help. It just feels nice to vent anyoumously. It just feels like a long time I felt excited for anything. But it's not I am on crying jags, it's just an emptiness.

4072,"Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt's like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense, almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there's a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly.

**TL;DR** **Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die**

Posting here because I can't act anymore. I can't pretend that everything is okay. I've gained 6kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck, but I also don't care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I'm not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else. 

I think about self harming a lot. I mean, not only suicide but other forms of physical pain. But then I remember I've got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn't change anything.

I don't have a good reason to want to die. There's no major crisis. The relationship breakdown was over 4 months ago and I'm mostly over that. I have enough money for everything I essentially need. Sure, I'll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck, and I'll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk,  but that's not it either. It's not even the fact that I have about three friends, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February - because,  at the moment.people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with. I don't want anything to do with anyone right now. I can't pretend to not be depressed when I'm around other people anymore. It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work, and I know I don't do a very good job at that as it is. 

It's not really any of that. I just don't care anymore. About any of it. Any of life. I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work 3 days a week. Do look pale and run down as shit though. Going through the motions, I guess, while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about suicide all day, every day. I suspect it's the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post-operative depression, but also the general state of the world. 

Now, I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I'd probably feel better. But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that, because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement. So, I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants. It might be a complete waste of time and money, as it has been in the past, but I can't help hoping that this time will be different, that this time maybe we'll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing.

Also going to see the psychologist on Monday. It's been difficult to get an appointment (a) because it's bloody expensive and (b) because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she's super busy and hard to get into. I'm hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she's the best psychologist I have ever seen. I haven't kept it up because of financial stress, and my mental health has suffered as a result. But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while.

It's been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too. I can't concentrate for more than 2 seconds. I'm agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time. I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not. I can't remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual, and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock. 

I wasn't entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn't want to be on antidepressants again, and I sure as hell didn't want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again. But at the moment it's gotten to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore, so might as well be totally upfront.

I think I'm too lazy to actually kill myself. Having been there and tried that more than once, getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don't have the energy for. Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have, I don't want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with. I'd need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up.

And that's the nub of it. Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures. I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware, that that would be a fate far worse than this. My life could be 100,000x worse than it currently is, no doubt. But knowing that doesn't change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it's way across my brain.

I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty. And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they're not alone.",1,days brain silently aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaits like indescribable emotional pain mied intense overwhelming desire life end resulting feeling theres corner brain screaming endlessly tl dr shoutout trying life brain wants die posting cant act anymore cant pretend okay ive gained ekg week eating rubbish super yuck dont care brain swamped intense suicidal ideation im sufficiently distracted thoughts suicide come like blam blam blam blam drowning think self harming lot mean suicide forms physical pain remember ive got way scars additional scars high pain tolerance doesnt change dont good reason want die theres major crisis relationship breakdown 4 months ago im money essentially need sure ill probably need major operations genetics suck ill definitely need double mastectomy point cancer risk thats fact friends time hung friend february momentpeople ehausting want interaction dont want right cant pretend depressed im people anymore takes energy pretend normal smile laugh work know dont good job dont care anymore life amazed things like shower brush teeth pay bills work 3 days week look pale run shit thought going motions guess brain screaming want die gotten point im thinking suicide day day suspect general anaesthetic colonoscopy sending deep end postoperative depression general state world know stopped eating crap eercise got sunshine effort social id probably feel better gets point bring getting dressed maintaining basic personal hygiene mammoth achievement going monday ask antidepressants complete waste time money past cant help hoping time different time maybe try different drug actually capacity overcome intrusive suicidal thoughts eercise things know need wellbeing going psychologist monday difficult appointment bloody epensive huge chunk general population huge stresses shes super busy hard im hoping money continue shes best psychologist seen havent kept financial stress mental health suffered results think time able stick hard depression screwed cognitive function sleep cant concentrate 2 seconds im agitated drowning aniety time sleep late wake early like cant remember takes times longer process understand usual constantly feel dumb rock wasnt entirely honest doctor time went didnt want antidepressants sure hell didnt want run risk mental hospital moment gotten point dont care anymore totally upfront think im lazy actually kill having tried getting right takes lot planning organising logistics dont energy especially plans suicide dont want leave stuff family deal id need sort belongings affairs etc etc etc sure money cover potential funeral medical epenses fucked thats nub human beings incredibly resilient incredibly fragile creatures think keeps going times like know failed suicide left half brain dead aware fate far worse life 100 000 worse currently doubt knowing doesnt change incessant suicidal impulse blamming way brain wanted needed tell feel right completely honesty maybe resonate feel right help feel theyre
4073,"The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don't want to be selfish.. but I really want to do it.For the past 4-5 years, I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt the lives of others.  I know that if I killed myself, I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it.  
So, I guess it's good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others, but that's not the issue here.
I just don't want to live. I don't like life.  I know that if I were more ""optimistic,"" I could maybe have a better life.  but, I've tried being optimistic and that doesn't work out, either, because I always end up disappointed.
I've gotten to the point where I'm just faking life.  I do what I need to do to fit in.  
I know it's been five years (ish) since I've felt this way, but I'm wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say ""screw it"" and do it.  I also attempted, once, about 5 years ago (when I first started having these thoughts) and one of my close friends (no longer close) helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions.
So yeah, I realize that other people would be disappointed.  But I want to do things for myself. Well, I guess by that, I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself..

I've gone on about why I feel suicidal and how I don't believe suicide is the wrong choice for some people.  So don't think I'm only posting here because his death made me want to talk about things.

Anyways, I admire his courage.  I am far too afraid to kill myself, even though I know I should.

I'm bitter that this person is getting so much attention on social media, so much *affection* on social media.  I'm jealous.  I want a modicum of that affection.

And yet I know that if I got it, it wouldn't matter because I'll only accept it if it comes from certain people, the ones I seemingly arbitrarily decided to declare ""important"".

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

P.S. I want to warn everyone on social media sharing the suicide hotlines and all that about how those hotlines are terrible for helping those in need as most of us have found out.

4137,"I think I'm struggling with a lot of derealization/dissociation so that could be the reason, or it could just be my depression, either way it's making me more depressed.

I don't feel like I am anywhere. I'm just floating about, completely senseless, in a void. My senses technically work, I can see (although I have the usual derealization visual snow and stuff), I have ears, I have skin. But they don't feel like they work like they should. I can't feel a hug for what a hug is meant to be, you might as well hug a fridge. I could smell something and tell you what it is, but I can't appreciate it. I can look at something but I can't say for certain that it's even there in front of me or that I'm even looking at it, if it were a figment of my imagination I would have the same confidence in it. It's so hard to explain. It's like a dream. In fact no, my dreams feel more real.

If I can't feel anything like I'm in a sensory deprivation tank, then how do I know that this isn't just how reality is? Because I have a few memories that I cling on to. For example I sort of remember what's its like to breathe the winter air. Or walk in a big city. But I also feel like I've been numb for as long as I can remember. I want it to end, I want to feel human again and live life as I'm supposed to experience it.

I don't know why where ever I go feels so wrong. Why each place I go feels like I'm in the wrong timeline or someone else's life. Almost all relationships feel fake, or maybe I just have bad friends. It always (for years) feels like I'm supposed to be somewhere else, but I don't know where, and I don't know why. And I worry the second I go somewhere new the feelings will chase me. I hate my home, but I don't know why. It's a nice place, it's pretty, people are (mostly) nice but it's like the second someone sees me I feel them thinking ""she doesn't belong here"" and I don't want to either. Alarm bells in my head won't stop ringing about how everything is wrong.

I feel like a ticking time bomb, I don't see an end to this hell and when I'm reminded of that it's when the darkest thoughts  and feelings take over. When I try mindfulness and ""being present"" it seems to have the opposite effect and I sink back into myself, into the void further.

Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.

I don’t get invited anywhere I don’t have any real friends just people ik through football when I join conversations I’m always brushed off or I’m the joke and I know they shit talk me behind my back I’m left out of everything and never invited . But when I play those same people and a shit ton of others that don’t talk to me are quick to compliment me and celebrate with me or its weird like kinda bend a knee to me. I know they dont like me but my ability and it’s the same way for every one of my relationships my best friend doesn’t talk to me unless it’s about football and it’s always underhanded comments like  he wishes he had my size and I’m left to find out what’s going on with him through others  cause he doesn’t talk to me about him even though I care and I told him that I do. My parents only ever talk to me about getting a scholarship literally nothing else. Any other parental figure does the same I had a bad concussion and talked to my coach about my worries continuing playing football and he brushed me off telling me I worrying over nothing it took me three months to clear protocol(which is triple the time of a normal recovery) and I’m still not the same. Ik my problems aren’t close to some people’s on here but ik if I just ended it right now the only thing people would care about is who would fill my spot on the depth chart.

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

**Yes it is.**


I'm in a strange emotional state right now. I don't know how I should be starting my story.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. But I'll try to make it as clear as possible.


My house has never been one to display much affection. Thats not to say we don't love each other, or someone is overtly abusive, but emotions are not shown very often (do I care too much? or maybe I don't care at all and I'm faking it.) As a result, communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often. Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here (parents were refugees from Viet Nam).

My father never graduated high school. He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church. All his life, he has done manual labor of some sort, and currently works as a mechanic at a self-owned (although beginning to fail) mechanic shop. Despite all this, he will never *ever* pass by an opportunity to help someone, whether it is through money, work, or otherwise. In my eyes, he is practically a saint, despite some minor flaws (gambling, which he has fixed, and a little bit of drinking). This is because no matter what, he will help and expect nothin in return. He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face, even though it may end up costing him. Throughout my childhood, he was (and still is) working six days a week, from 7AM to 7PM at the shop, and sometimes even as late as 9PM. He works all day, and he works hard, even though the business is meager, he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home. Because he worked so much, I could never see him  often, and as a child, I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect, but I never quite knew why. Of course, now that I have grown older (19) I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up. I love him more than words can explain for it, and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer. Don't get me wrong, he's still healthy and alive, but I just wish I could get closer to him, but I dont know how. At all. And it kills me.

My mother was one of the ""boat people"" that fled Viet Nam, leaving her parents when she was only 15. At only a week out to sea, however, her boat was caught up by a Chinese (Hong Kong)? patrol boat, and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong. Thankfully, because this was towards t he end of the conflict, they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America (due to political asylum or something. I can't recall). When she arrived (living with her aunt/uncle who were already here at the time) her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school. After that, she perservered and went on, despite having limited English skills, to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. Again, my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people, even if it costs her, as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives. (However, she has a quick temper. And I mean quick.) On one hand, I guess you could say I'm closer to my mom than my dad, since she had more education, so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general, but on the other, I just felt that there was always a kind of ""barrier"" between us, as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn't have with my mom.

I know this is getting long, and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly. I just want to note that at this point, I have mostly calmed down, and my thoughts are getting more lucid. However, I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out. Furthermore, the nature of my ""issue"" is something that has and probably will recur constantly, so, while I am in control of my thoughts, I figure pre is better than post.

As you can see from my descriptions, I hold both of my parents in very high regards, to the point where, when I was younger (and to a certain extent, even now), I could see them do no wrong. Growing up, everything I did, I did it to make them happy, to please them, to constnatly seek their approval. And even now, I see nothing wrong with that, especially when I consider that everything I have now, is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide. And I am truly, eternally  grateful. I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children, providing them with the same (albeit unspoken) love and care that my parents have shown me. I have learned so much as a person from each of them, the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father, and the necessity of knowledge, determination and respect from my mother. Again, I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid. However, this is where the problem begins.

Even at a young age, if my parents ever fought each other, or got mad at me or my brother (regardless of fault) I would blame myself. I would not tell them I blamed myself, but in my heart, I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault. And thus, I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them.This worked fine, until I'd say starting about 5 or 6 years ago, when family issues began cropping up.

As I mentioned earlier, my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect. My dad is very quiet and softspoken, and often will take t he blame, in order to diffuse any situation. (For that, respect him immensely. Seriously. His ability to maintain composure was astounding.) When my brother began to reach *that age* where everything and everyone is out to get you, a lot of fights broke out in the family, because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and ""americanized"" my brother was becoming. Needless to say, fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down, and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure (but of course, blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together. As I said earlier, from my dad, I developed a kind of ""do everything I can"" mentality towards my family. I refused to become a broken statistic). The fights grew in number, and volume, my brother became more rebellious, my father began getting tired, etc etc.

Fast forward to the present. I know this is getting long, and to be honest, everytime I write something, I realize I have more to write, but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard.

4239,"I tried to kill myself the other nightI don't really know how to talk about this. Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up. 

I feel sick because I haven't eaten again too. But it doesn't make a difference, I'm still fat. I'm not losing weight. 

My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am. I tried to run outside naked in 4 degree snowy weather and throw myself into water. I didn't even make it outside. My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee. The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am. 

I've been married for six years. I've been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four. Ex boyfriend. Yeah, look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex. 

My husband is an INTJ. He loves me deeply but he's terrible at showing it. He's very neurotic. (read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you've got his biography). He's also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac. His upbringing was conservative-Christian-style abusive, and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything. I'm ESFJ, I try to keep everyone happy, but I guess I'm shit at it. I rarely clean because I'm always tired. Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Some days I just can't anymore. Those are the days we fight. 

He loves me, he works very hard for our family. I just feel very lonely and not understood. Or that he even tries to understand. He just wants the fight to stop, but also to ""win"" it. To explain to me with anger-skewed logic how I'm wrong nomatter what, in the heat of a fight. When not in a fight, he still doesn't know how to do things make me happy even though we've been married for six years. Even though I know how to make him happy. I've tried to tell him sweet things to try, he'll do it for a day or two then forget. I feel so lonely. 

At some point I'd started cutting, but rarely. Maybe once every few months, then a year or two between. 

Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I'd been ok with it, our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much. He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too. I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life, and the connection was instantaneous and intense. We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days. He understood me, the way he thought made sense. We had the same interests, liked the same games, liked the same themes. My husband was jealous that we had so much in common, but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn't complain much. 

My boyfriend was my social life. I told him everything, though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another. We moved around a lot, so I wasn't able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years. Well after he was already over me, though he always said that he loved me. 

We kept moving, then I got pregnant. He was sure I'd disappear, but I didn't. 

No one would hire me pregnant. I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby. Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me. 

My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was 8 months pregnant. The birth was traumatic for me, the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn't need. The new baby was colicky and miserable. My husband's job was hell, the commute was hell. I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend. Then the job cut everyone's already spectacularly low pay down by 25%. We lost our apartment. I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother. (borderline fundamentalist) My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute, for shit pay, while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office. He had sleep apnea and wasn't sleeping. He was in hell. 

His mother is a hoarder. I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick. I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell. He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump. I was supposed to be illustrating a children's book I hated. I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don't like looking at it. Talking to Seth was hell. I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give. We would be snappy and miserable at each other. So I stopped talking to him. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it. I talked to him a ridiculous amount. I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone's unending stress, and talked to him while I tried to work. He loved me then, dearly. He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together. It was unrealistic. 

Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays, then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around 11pm. He would be tired and angry and snappy. He didn't want to look at the baby. We would almost always fight. He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous. He didn't have his girlfriend anymore. It was the ugliest time in our relationship. It was the ugliest time in my life, except for now I think. 

Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth. My boyfriend didn't manage well. Suddenly that constant attention was pulled. I couldn't be on calls much at all. I had less childcare and I was severely depressed. My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too, after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months. It was rocky. For awhile my boyfriend railed against it, fought to have me back like we were before. Even if my husband hadn't be jealous, that could never happen. Not without leaving my husband, and through it all I didn't want to. I still loved him. He couldn't ask me to, but I know my boyfriend wished I would. Its a natural selfish thing we all do. I'd been unfair and told him things I shouldn't have, told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband. It wasn't business to share. I'd planted strife between them. 

I'd always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever. He'd pulled away, gotten a lot more quiet. He didn't respond to everything I said anymore, instead I'd be writing pages to myself. That was around two years in. My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh. We moved for the fifth time in the 2.5 years I'd known my boyfriend. We got an apartment. I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything. Also having a 1.5 yr old toddler was tough, and my relationship was still strained with my husband. My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from. We were making plans to meet. 

Then I found out I was pregnant again. A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly. Who knows if I'd been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow, I'll never know. It was dangerous. They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused. I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn't in danger of ectopic pregnancy. Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant. He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people, e-clubs. He still played games with me, and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit. I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure that was the moment it was really over. 

The pregnancy was miserable. My husband doesn't do well with small children at all. Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably, and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together. Even though I talked throughout the day every single day, my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring. He'd offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days.

I wasn't carrying a baby it seemed, I was carrying a nuclear bomb. It was a long, lonely, miserable pregnancy. I cried so much. When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean, this time because I'd been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis. It was my fault. 

You can't have a trip with a new baby. You can't have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you're breastfeeding. While family is constantly in and out. While my life was hell. At least I'd thought so. I should've just let him in. I'm practical to a fault, but I don't think he was even that interested at that point. We still talked every day. We played games together. I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life. I held onto him, and he was sort of there, but I railed against the distance that was so plain. 

Finally, we made plans. The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days. We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live. My husband's girlfriend would come up to meet him too, a girl he wasn't much into anymore either, but wanted to give a chance. Just weeks before the trip, my boyfriend had a heart attack.

It was the true end, because when he wrote about it on his FA, and that girl from before attached herself to him. He began talking to her constantly, more than me. Roleplaying with her, doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new. She was married too. She just didn't have children. 

He talked to her for months. She began posting pictures of their characters fucking. She told me to my e-face that ""it wasn't like that"" and she ""respected my relationship"", meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new ""boyfriend."" 

I'd postponed the trip to October for him to heal. It was for two weeks. It was pleasant but he was distant, and had issues making love to me. He spent a lot of time on his phone. The second week my husband's girlfriend came up, and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow/birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine. It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn't know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me. We had a fight where we had to talk it out. It was awkward. 

The rest of the trip was ok but, the second week was stressful and messy. I'd made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend. It was too much. 

At Christmas I found out that they were together. She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together. I got very upset. Then I got dumped. I cried, I was told at first that I had been chosen. The pictures came down. We got each other Christmas gifts. 

Then they all reappeared. And he chose her. I spiraled. It was the worst Christmas of my life. I spent hours on the phone with him. The first few times were sweet and caring. Eventually he couldn't keep the facade up anymore. 

He plastered her on his profile immediately. 

I cut myself. Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling. At some point before then I'd figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning. It wouldn't make me feel good, but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold, lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt. 

I took a break from the computer. Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday. I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband. He was happy to ""have me back"" and since I wasn't outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better. 

A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend, still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again. Then she posts about how he had visited her. In November. Immediately after seeing me. 

I'd been cheated on in the flesh. 

I found out about a week and a half ago. I called him. I cried a little, but I was mostly numb. He didn't sound very sorry about it. I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me. He said he would. He barely tried. 

I cut again. Four stripes to breathe. 

Then a few days later he leaves to go see her. He's at her house right now. Fucking her. I was stupid, I kept looking at his profile on FA. As long as things weren't being posted maybe it was going badly. Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared. He knew I was following him, so even if I hadn't been checking, they all flooded my feed. I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it.

Imagine if someone got a divorce, then a month later when his ex found out she'd been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together. 

It was the final blow. I've never felt so ugly, so fat, so useless in my life, or so alone. My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it. The time I do spend is away from my children. My house is a shitpile because I don't clean. 

When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad. I was angry and tired. I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile. I snapped. I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up. He didn't like it, he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical. I ran downstairs. I've threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo-chamber fights, he didn't even follow. Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs. I told him to fuck off. He tore into me verbally, I tore back. We worked each other up until I was done. I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds, to actually care. Just fucking correct until I gave in. 

I ran for the door. I was naked. I tried to get it open but he stopped me. I ran for the other. He stopped me again. I ran a third time and got it halfway open, he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed. He held me down until I gave up. 

I should've gone to the hospital but I didn't. 

He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn't do anything. 

I asked my ex to call me, he said he would then he didn't. 

I'm not worth it. I'm not worth bothering with. I'm not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air.

I'm so. sad. 

Sorry for the life story. It doesn't really tell that my husband is a good person, that my boyfriend was too... He said so many sweet things... but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were. That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful.

Some days I don't know how to keep going. The house is getting steadily more disgusting. I'm getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep, but I don't get the option.

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again. At school I have no friends anymore, when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that, so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me

I can't even try to be friends with my ex because she can't even look at me and she won't tell me why. 

It's eating me up. I can't live like this anymore. 

I just want to wrap my arms around her and never let go. She is so intelligent and beautiful. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met. Now she has started to walk around with the ""friend"" who I mentioned before, that ""friend"" made my life hell for months, she is the reason why I have cut myself on many occasions, she also told her (My ex) to kill herself constantly to the point where she was about to.

“I failed as a sibling, child, and person. I am so sorry. Since I was little I knew I was stupid and a mistake. I never learned how to talk to others. Always so anxious and felt like I was gonna throw up. The few times I did open up to people it ended badly. I’ve constantly been the family embarrassment. It never even had to be said sometimes.

4325,"last night my semi-boyfriend (who shall be referred to as JT) told me he didn't foresee himself being able to love me, despite putting in effort, and that he felt it was best we go our separate ways. I cried and cried and begged him not to leave me, but he said it had to be this way. he's moving across the world soon, so today was probably the last time I'd ever see him again. the one comfort I have in this situation is that he cried with me and he seemed to be genuinely heartbroken at the decision he made. 

it's not just him though, before this guy there was another who shall be referred to as SP, who left me for another girl. My ex, who I dated for two years, kept wanting to sleep with other girls while being with me. The list goes on and on, mostly ending with them abandoning me for one reason or another. It's always ""you're so smart and pretty and funny, but..."", and I don't know how much more of this I can take.

when I was a kid, my parents never told me they loved me or cared about me, nor did they show it - so I grew up believing that they didn't. that's my theory as to why I put my heart and my soul into pleasing potential partners, and why it's so devastating for me especially when things go awry. I've felt so alone for my entire life, so if a pretty boy shows up and gives me some attention or affection I fall head over heels for them. I have so much love to give, but I think people eventually realize that I'm absolutely wack and leave me.",1,night semiboyfriend shall referred told didnt foresee able love despite putting effort felt best separate ways cried cried begged leave said way hes moving world soon today probably time id comfort situation cried genuinely heartbroken decision thought guy shall referred spy left girl e dated years kept wanting sleep girls list goes ending abandoning reason youre smart pretty funny dont know kids parents told loved cared grew believing didnt thats theory heart soul pleasing potential partners devastating especially things awry ive felt entire life pretty boy shows gives attention affection fall head heels love think people eventually realize im absolutely wack leave

4339,"I'm heading back into that direction...Sorry about the length.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

But with my anxiety spiking for the past few years, I can't. Even when I am not doing anything I am worried. My headache is piercing through my brain. Why do I feel this way.

4349,"Feeling alone and unwantedToday makes the 1 year anniversary of me [19M] moving 1000 miles away from my home to go to my dream college. I moved south because of what my brothers told me, “move away from home, push yourself outside of your comfort zone and you will be amazing with how much you grow”. Well, the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity. All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me. How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, I’m so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I can’t leave my bed I’m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself.

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same ""it'll get better!"" ""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

Happy new year. If you see any hope at all, you better cling to that and don't let go until you've got enough hope and happiness to last you lifetimes.

4377,"19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine. My name is Zairen and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 2nd year Csci student, a DJ Training Director, and my time is coming to an end.",1,19 queer pointlessive struggling thoughts middle school year worse ive realised pointless compared peers theyve permeated head ive outcast people groups friends im gets invited parties hangout theyre busy ask fail high school period constant downs aniety hadnt realised gender queer time greatly harmed sense self identity ability present ive particularly social awkward anious college things supposed change new faces new resources things immediately went shit classes meet people outside hall finally realised gender queer felt feel like freak nonbinary arab means receiving fraction percent acceptedness support binary arab peers received ive tried attending gsa meetings ive treated outsider dont fit concepts queerness spring semester semester repeats combine potential financial roommate issues feel like time coming end cant parents embarrassment having trans child dropped school stress academics tearing apart physically mentally summer opportunity throw dam near college sat nearly 4 hours wouldve looked like fishing accident saved family embarrassment failures wish plan potentially crash car tree particularly rainy night looks like accident ill pretend fine zaire use pronouns im year csi student training director time coming end

Why could I not even make a simple application, I couldn't even start it, I couldn't even just register an account with my email and password. How could I not even do something as simple as that? I'm so depressed man, I finally admit.

I don't even know where I can find another job now. I graduated University this June and I've been tired ever since. The only jobs opening now from August will be Intaking in September 2022 so this whole year will be wasted.

I cannot stick to a job and do something small like this and I see others in my graduating class doing so well.

I quit my last two jobs because the environments were so toxic and management often ignored people. I cannot fathom working 32 much less 40 hours with constant hell. People tell me to look into hobbies and make friends as much as possible, but I'm just so tired after work. Hell, I work 9pm to 5am so what can I even do.

4396,"Hello, I’m Thomas..
My name is one of the very few things I still know about myself. To keep things shortish I won’t go through my whole childhood. Ever since middle school I’ve dealt with severe anxiety, which soon or later also lead to severe depression. The only thing that got me through these times and kept a smile on my face were video games. I’m 25 years old now and will be 26 in two months time, I have absolutely nothing going for me and it KILLS me. After high school I was drafted to a junior hockey team where I played for a year, nothing really came of it. During this time, on one of our breaks I came home to see my family. Everything seemed normal until one day I walked into my garage to find my mom in a running vehicle with the garage door shut and yelled for my dad, thankfully we were able to get her out of the vehicle and to the hospital. This is just one moment in my life where I believe my brain chemistry just changed FOREVER. I’ve lost my ability to trust anyone or get too close to anyone because of this incident and a few others that I feel don’t need to be mentioned. I’ve never really been close to my family or my extended family because my parents always had an issue with EVERYONE. I also lost literally every single one of my friends that I knew for years because of my anxiety and the fact that they all had things going for them and I have nothing going for me, so that made it hard to face them, I felt like a failure. I became comfortable with people I’ve met online, I considered and still consider them some of the best people I’ve ever met. Going back, after my season in Dallas ended I came home and went to a community college online for two years, due to my anxiety problems I simply couldn’t gain the courage to go to class in person. Being that the classes were online, this basically meant I was still gaming all of the time. Fast forward to now, I’ve had probably 5 or 6 jobs that I can never hold for more than 3 months. I feel like such a loser, I have no job currently, crippling anxiety and depression, no credit score, I don’t pay any of my bills, I just do not know what to do anymore. I’ve been in and out of counseling and I can’t go back on medication because I won’t be under my parents insurance anymore soon. I feel like time has caught up to me and my only way out of this pain is to just end it. I stay up until 5-6am just thinking of how I can turn my life around and I can’t think of a reasonable path. Thinking of going back to work even makes me anxious, it’s that bad. The worst part is my parents just think I’m lazy, but I’m not. It’s the opposite, I want a normal life where I can go to work and feel like I’ve contributed to society, but my mental issues have quite literally never allowed me to work without being overwhelmed and most of the times walking out of some jobs even on day one during training. I just don’t know anymore.. my laptop and pc were taken from me, as sad as that sounds at 25 years old. Those were my outlet where I felt at peace and had people to talk to for the last 10 years. It’s been two weeks since I’ve had those taken from me and I just feel like there’s just nothing left to live for anymore. The last two weeks I’ve laid in my room with only my phone all day to avoid my family until they go to bed, then I get up and eat something. I can’t believe I am where I am, I used to be fit, motivated, and had friends. I’m just so lost and alone.",1,hello im thomas things know things shorts wont childhood middle school ive dealt severe aniety soon later lead severe depression thing got times kept smile face video games im 25 years old 26 months time absolutely going kills high school drafted junior hockey team played years came time breaks came home family normal day walked garage find mom running vehicle garage door shut yelled dad thankfully able vehicle hospital moment life believe brain chemistry changed forever ive lost ability trust close incident feel dont need mentioned ive close family etended family parents issue lost literally single friends knew years aniety fact things going going hard face felt like failure comfortable people ive met online considered consider best people ive met going season dallas ended came home went community college online years aniety problems simply couldnt gain courage class person classes online basically meant gaming time fast forward ive probably 5 6 jobs hold 3 months feel like loser job currently crippling aniety depression credit score dont pay bills know anymore ive counseling cant medication wont parents insurance anymore soon feel like time caught way pain end stay 56am thinking turn life cant think reasonable path thinking going work makes anious bad worst parents think im lazy im opposite want normal life work feel like ive contributed society mental issues literally allowed work overwhelmed times walking jobs day training dont know anymore laptop pa taken sad sounds 25 years old outlet felt peace people talk 10 years weeks ive taken feel like theres left live anymore weeks ive laid room phone day avoid family bed eat cant believe fit motivated friends im lost

4418,"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 

SO: I want to die 

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 

SO: I'm already hurting myself 

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 

What should I do, you guys? I don’t know what is going on, I don’t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don’t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don’t know if I should stay with them if this continues—not because they have depression, but because they won’t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
We’ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I’m not an antidepressant. I’m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don’t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

I am 15 and I have attempted suicide multiple times since the age of 7. I have had social anxiety for a few years now and I don’t care how painful death is, it’s better than the torture this is. (Sorry if that sounds cringe) Due to the social anxiety I have no social connections of any type outside of my single mother. I haven’t gone through anything bad in my life, but I don’t think you really need a justification for killing your self other than it is what I have chosen to do.

4424,"I have known my best friend for over 6 years now, since I was in high school. She has been with me through my best and worst points, and we both know everything about one another. Plus, we are still quite in love with each other. The constant snag has always been that she lives in England and I live in the US. BUT the biggest issue is she has really bad depression.

Over the years, she has completely cut me out of her life because she has gotten to such low points and has admitted that it has been hard for her to even live her life let alone talk to me. She also confessed that she nearly took her own life at one point.

How do I reach out to her and convince her to let me in? All I want is to be able to comfort her as a friend...but it's impossible if she doesn't want to talk. I've been through my own bouts of depression due to fibromyalgia so I understand how it feels, but I wanted people to reach out to me.

4425,"""Suicide is selfish"", ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". Bullshit.I have heard these for years. It drives me fucking insane. I find it amazing people don't see the blatant hypocrisy.

They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves, and put their family through pain. But somehow, they don't see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don't have to suffer through the loss.

Like really, as if it is isn't enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal, they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all. Unreal. And I'm the selfish one?

Oh, and my other favorite. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Yeah, ok. Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like. There is nothing temporary about it. It is forever. You might get some brief breaks from it, but it's never gone for good.

My mother has verbally abused me (and almost physically) since I was a young teen, about 13-14 years old.

I have like one friend and I most often hate her because she's younger than me and we don't match as people anymore, then one other friend I sleep with of whom will probably drop me due to my boring life and lack of care for things these days.

4448,"My suicidal thoughts.I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad. However I do want to express these problems and talk about them. I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now. I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die. I just feel so lost, I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please. I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering? Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority. People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future. One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life.

4454,"Hey everyone!

First of all I want to say that I am really proud of everyone who is strong enough to share personal emotions, moments of weakness etc. online, with friends&family etc.

I've been living with depression for most of my life because I've been through a lot and it took me a long time to admit that seeking help from a professional is the way to go or at least wouldn't hurt.

As you can probably tell from the overall tone of my post I managed to develop/foster techniques that help me restore some balance. That being said, and I guess a lot of people will feel the same, negativity sometimes comes back out of nowhere and drags me down into a black-hole and digging my way out of it sometimes takes more and sometimes less time. It feels like I am still falling into that hole but the shovel I am using to get out of it is of higher quality and more effective than it used to be.

The reason I am writing this post is curiosity and hope for some opinions on a certain technique I've been using to manage with stressful situations or nagging thoughts.

I often heard that writing about your negative thoughts, about situations that evoke those feelings, just about whatever, helps us to tackle the problems much more than thinking about them.

My question is, and I know it's a rather small difference but here me out, whether or not it's better to write things down on my computer/digital or with an actual pen..

Writing about my emotions/feelings in general feels rather productive but I really tend to write about them on my computer because of my rather fast typing speed, which makes it feel more time efficient I assume. It feels like I am answering my question to a degree while asking the question but do you think or did you experience a difference between using pen&paper ""vs"" keyboard in that regard?

If you wrote about your feelings before and felt benefits from it I would be glad to hear about your thoughts and if you never considered writing about them with pen&paper it would also be interesting to hear the reasons behind that.

I didn't give too many specifics about my ""background"" and what makes me struggle with depression but since I am in a rather good emotional spot right now I didn't really feel the need to do that. 

If you actually read all the way through, and even if you just jumped to the last sentence, I hope you had a wonderful day and I wish you all the best because you and everyone else deserves it :).",1,hey want proud strong share personal emotions moments weakness etc online friendsfamily etc ive living depression life ive lot took long time admit seeking help professional way wouldnt hurt probably tell overall tone post managed develop foster techniques help restore balance said guess lot people feel negativity comes drags blackhole digging way takes time feels like falling hole shovel higher quality effective reason writing post curiosity hope opinions certain technique ive manage stressful situations nagging thoughts heard writing negative thoughts situations evoke feelings helps tackle problems thinking question know small difference better write things computer digital actual pen writing emotions feelings general feels productive tend write computer fast typing speed makes feel time efficient assume feels like answering question degree asking question think eperience difference penpaper ivs keyboard regard wrote feelings felt benefits glad hear thoughts considered writing penpaper interesting hear reasons didnt specifics background makes struggle depression good emotional spot right didnt feel need actually read way jumped sentence hope wonderful day wish best deserves

4462,"I'm mentally deficient and I refuse to live with it.Hi, I'm Steve. I'm 17, I live with autism and mental deficiencies, and I'm going to kill myself right after I submit this god damn post.

I'm not posting this because I want help. I'm posting this because these words need to go somewhere, and honestly I don't know of a better place where a message like this would be acceptable.

Back to the subject. I'm autistic, and I have some really bad mental deficiencies and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I took a cognitive test when I was 15. I have an IQ of 77, and I was ranked either ""Deficient"" or ""Borderline Deficient"" on everything. Fuck. It's so hard living with the fact that your limits are so fucking low compared to the rest of the general population and you will never fucking be able to achieve your dreams because of some bullshit that I can't fucking help.

I'm in the special education program at my school and I fucking hate it. They teach jack shit and group me with kids that screech and shit their pants. I can talk normally, I just don't want to unless I'm asked. I'm mentally fucking deficient but I want to be taught something that's above preschool level. I've tried telling my mom it's not enough for me but she just dismisses me and tells me I won't make it in mainstream education. I try telling my special ed teachers I want more, but they dismiss me too and then make jokes about me behind my back like I can't fucking hear them. Hey, Mr. Janssen, when you read this, fuck you. I heard every little bit of shit you talked about me. Mrs. Huang, fuck you. I heard you call me inbred. Ms. Baker, fuck you too. I get it, I'm not smart and I never fucking will be but I want to be taught more than fucking preschool shit. Fuck.

I'll say it again: you have no fucking clue how hard it is to live when you know that your limits are much much lower than the average person, you will never graduate high school, you will never go to college, and you will never get any respectable job, and generally your life will be very unfulfilling. I always dreamed of being a coder, but guess what? That requires you to be smart and guess who isn't smart? Me. I tried to teach myself. It doesn't click and while I love it I'm so fucking bad and it takes me hours to figure out things that are ""super basic"". I can't do it. It's too hard.

I'm not willing to live a life in which I can't be a normal person. I just want to graduate high school, go to college, get a good job, and just have a normal life. But all of that has been made inaccessible by the fact that I'm in fucking special ed and won't even graduate high school and will forever be dependent on my parents.

I don't want to burden my parents any more by being the dead weight piece of shit that I am. And I don't want to doom myself to a life of suffering.

I hope you all can now sympathize with me.

Goodbye.",1,im mentally deficient refuse live itthis im steve im 17 live autism mental deficiencies im going kill right submit god damn post im posting want help im posting words need honestly dont know better place message like acceptable subject im autistic bad mental deficiencies fucking killing inside took cognitive test 15 iq 77 ranked deficient borderline deficient fuck hard living fact limits fucking low compared rest general population fucking able achieve dreams bullshit cant fucking help im special education program school fucking hate teach jack shit group kids screech shit pants talk normally dont want im asked im mentally fucking deficient want taught thats preschool level ive tried telling mom dismisses tells wont mainstream education try telling special ed teachers want dismiss jokes like cant fucking hear hey mri jansen read fuck heard little bit shit talked huang fuck heard inbred bakery fuck im smart fucking want taught fucking preschool shit fuck ill fucking clue hard live know limits lower average person graduate high school college respectable job generally life unfulfilling dreamed coders guess requires smart guess isnt smart tried teach doesnt click love im fucking bad takes hours figure things super basic cant hard im willing live life cant normal person want graduate high school college good job normal life inaccessible fact im fucking special ed wont graduate high school forever dependent parents dont want burden parents dead weight piece shit dont want doom life suffering hope sympathize goodbye

First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 

Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 

I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 

I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 

I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music. I cant do both cause i feel u dont have enough time in a day. Im lost. Im sad. Im happy when i take drugs. Im happy when i drink. Im not a druggie or an alcoholic.  I just i feel nothing anymore.

4465,Piling up I have severe depression and aspergers. I am 23. I'm gay. I cannot relate to people outside of a very small group of people and part of how I learned to relate to others is through drugs. I am on and off but don't really associate with my old friends who still use heavily pretty often. When I do I feel welcome though and not judged so long as I'm getting high with them. I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left. Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy. I won't ever stop hurting and I don't have a life outside of feeling that pain anymore. ,1,piling severe depression aspergers 23 im gay relate people outside small group people learned relate drugs dont associate old friends use heavily pretty feel welcome judged long im getting high dont social skills life skills life better terrific failure ive learned surround people wouldnt judge criticize good stopped talking lot family didnt want dad siblings ive wanted die 13 years im tired thing drive younger thinking eventually support making artwork music creating emotional outlet left realize pointless wealthy work retail afford education taking loans suicide hate im fully aware deep resentment people feel fact people like eist going kill eventually cant possibly live escapism thing left pretending place people gave shit escaping fantasy wont stop hurting dont life outside feeling pain anymore

(just ignore this if you want to. i also feel pathetic for asking help from strangers on the internet : )

academic pressure in asia is extremely harsh.i was part of 1.11% students my age who scored straight A’s in elementary school national exam.always got first place in the batch.got 2nd place once,was scolded so bad by mom in front of friends and teachers.she was practically yelling.i was freakin 7 yo. embarrassed and traumatized.(not gonna include my kindergarten life bcs that memories hurts a little bit too much than other part of my life)

one thing that rubs salt into my wound is how different my parents treat my brother.nobody pressured him bcs he’s the only son(golden child..)when i ask my mom she simply said “he’s a boy and you’re a girl. boys are playful and that’s their nature, i can’t pressure him how i pressure you”oh istg it hurts. im not some kind of mannequin that doesn’t break and have no feelings. my entire childhood was pretty much ruined bcs of how hard i studied. adam gets expensive shit for stupid little things when i dont even have a cake for my birthday.he got nintendo for getting 3rd place when i only got more exercise books after getting 1st.but i never said anything, being the good girl I’m supposed to be

if i have issues with my parents why don’t i just talked it out with my friends?honey this mf right here got no friends.they’re so toxic, hating me for studying, talked behind my back and spread rumors until the seniors hates me. Bodyshamed me when im literally 45 kg until I developed bad habits like chewing without swallowing and occasionally digs my throat to throw up even when I don’t eat anything.quick reminder we stayed in hostel together. it’s not like i can put the toxicity aside and doesnt feel anything when we see each other every day

now im 17,takes science stream with new format that’s super hard (some topics include university syllabus) , going to sit for SPM (same as SAT) next march but already burnt out. online classes are hard bcs i have to stay at home with this family that im not even close with. i dont talk to any of them for almost a year even when we’re living under the same roof(i was rarely home after 13 bcs i enter private boarding highschool where we’re only home for two days every two months)

4497,"Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself. 

P.S. Yes, I recovered by depression with meds and therapist. You can see that this didn't help. Mental health care is very poor in my country. So no one will help me.

4516,"I have been seeing a therapist on a weekly basis for about 8-9 months now and during almost every single session we bring up my childhood and we are always able to connect one of my current issues to my childhood.

Why did I treat food as a reward when I was in college and starved myself until I got my work done? Because my mom wouldn't cook me food when she was mad at me when I was a kid. Why is my inner voice so harsh on myself and so focused on my flaws? Because my mom always focused on my flaws and overlooked my accomplishments when I was a kid. Why am I so insecure about my appearance? Because my mom always told me I am ugly and that I do not have a single good quality and compared me to every other kid she knew.

While it is nice to be able to identify the source of all of these toxic behaviors and self-sabotage and to know that is not all my fault, sometimes I feel like all this analysis just keeps me stuck in the past and angry at my mom who is now actively trying to improve her relationship with me. I feel like I am always internally fighting with my mom and sometimes I do get in arguments with her over that stuff which she finds burdensome. Sometimes she admits that she screwed up and other times she says that I have always been free to do whatever I want and that my current situation is my fault. Regardless of my mom's response, I just wanna get over the past. I wanna stop thinking about all of this. Is it possible that therapy is making me hold on to baggage that I just wanna get rid of? Sometimes I feel like the victim mentality is holding me back and keeping me from taking responsibility for my action.

I mean, what's the point? I keep holding on to some sort of faith, but things keep managing to get worse. I think to myself, ""it can't get worse."" But I lose more money, someone close to me dies.

4556,"I'm finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now. I'm 29 and I'm a fucking loser. I'm a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation. I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time. 

My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to. 

Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better. 

I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't. 

They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right? 

I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that. 

Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it?

Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that.

4585,"A few months ago I was severely depressed to the point where I did not even want to get out of bed, at that point I was probably in one of the worst places I had ever been in my life. It was to the point where I had physical pain in my chest, but I still could never bring myself to talk about it with someone cause I wouldn't want to be labeled as the ""fake depressed kid"". Over the past few months, I thought I was slowly getting better but I am in this weird state where I am not happy or sad, just numb. I can't get genuine enjoyment out of anything and I fake laugh more times than I can count. But even though I am numb I don't feel the urgency of something being wrong with me (it's hard to explain). It is like I have the same problems but I am just feeling neutral about everything. At this point I would rather be back in my depressed state cause at least it was a genuine feeling and not just this shitty state. I am even questioning if I am just faking it but I just don't know and I am too overwhelmed to try to think about this critically. So at this point, it is like my emotions are just ignoring these problems.

Sooooo, how should I start.

So I was diagnosed with depression when I was in 8th grade,now I just completed my 1st year of diploma .so I be having my 4 year anniversary to my beloved depression. 

The reason for depression,1 I was bullied, harassed, abused by my classmate from 1st grade to the last day of 10th grade.

2 my parents denied me every chance to grow as a person , the total number of trips I went to during my school years is astonishing 4. I didn't even got the chance to join any hobbies. The 1 I had was drawing but that was also shutdown by my parents as they thought It will interfere with my studies. 

3 everytime I went through mental breakdown, my family told me I was being manipulative and emotionally abusing them.

Other than these 3 reasons I have a friend group that are kind but how long will they keep me alive I don't know.

I thought of writing this because today morning I was playing game the ascent (you should try it ,it's a very cool game)I  am getting kinda good at playing and my mom was watching me as she was having tea.she said you are very good at playing game maybe you should try making one.i responded back making games is hard ,and I am only good at playing them otherwise I am worthless.my mom shuts up,but the word that came out of my mouth, sting me. I stopped playing and went straight into deep coma of depressing thought.
After that I started writing .

4606,"When I was a kid I was just happy, happy being a kid. They never teach you what to expect in adulthood. I'm a (23m) I work a minimum wage job £14,000 a year in customer services in a store. I'm supposed to smile and put effort into the customers. If I dont sell enough of what I sell the managers come down on me with so much pressure, it's honestly not worth it for the pay.

Where I live there is really no other jobs apart from IT jobs and Hospital jobs, all of which require degrees to get into. 

I have no friends, 0. I have no girlfriend, never have. Never partied, never been invited. Never danced, never kissed, none of that fun stuff that I'm supposed to be doing at this age. 

I was bullied at school, I don't like my own image, I have bad teeth that just keep getting worse no matter how well I look after them.

I live with my family still, I pay money to live there and they use me to do the labour in the household (building fences, painting, garden maintenance) no thank you, no nothing. Just, ""you live here, do the work"" despite paying to live their too.

My family never really thinks about me honestly, I'm never concluded in any decisions ever... dad cheated on my mom when I was 8... mom cheated with a married man after that... dads an alcoholic... I have no role models to look up to, never was taught how to shave.

I feel heavy. It's too hard to wade through life anymore. I just find myself thinking... wtf is the point of any of this?! What the fuck am I doing here? I could go, just go right now and no one would really care too much. They'd think ""what happened to him? That's terrible... ahh well..."" and move on with their life.

4689,"Today just set it off for me. I was doing well for a while. 

Earlier today, my dad came into my room to put up a bookshelf, he did nothing but complain about how my room looked or smelled. 

My sibling yelled at me because I was talking over him on a call with him and our friends but the truth is, I’m half deaf in one ear and he was talking super quiet so I had no idea he was talking at all. He then yelled at me because I “stole his friends” from him and that my friend replaced him with me which I can’t control. He then told our mother who got mad at me. He is also abusive to me. I got a lock on my door to protect myself from him. He has tried to pick that lock, break down my door, and thrown stuff at it. He gets mad that I “don’t use his preferred name” when he switches it daily and doesn’t bother telling me. I’ve had bruises from him, my mom has had black eyes and bite marks, my dad almost had his finger bitten off, and my grandma almost got stabbed in the head with a pen by him. (Not today but multiple times in the past few years.)

My hamster got out of his cage and I had to run on a wild goose chase to try and find him. I messed up my room more than it was in the process of finding him and now I have to clean it just to make it usable and I have breathing issues so that’s going to make it even more difficult than it was going to be. 

I have health issues including low blood sugar, anemia and hypoglycemia. On top of that, I have fast metabolism so no matter how much I eat, I can’t gain weight. I’m 89 pounds (about 40kg). I should weigh a lot more than I do. 

My parents always play the victim when I try to talk to them about how I feel. Ex: “Am I just a bad parent? You have everything you want.” If my sibling hits me and I hit back, I’m the bad guy because I “should know better”. Last time I talked to them about it, I ended up crying and we were all yelling and I got sent to my room, followed by texts from both my parents including how I’m “overreacting” or “making too big of a deal out of it”.

I’m transgender as well and have been bullied countless times for that. I’ve been called a queer, a f@ggot, a tr4nny, it, and a girl. I was also told to kms. My pronouns are specifically he/they. 

I was bullied my entire life even before I came out. Now, one of my childhood bullies is in my school. My friends always say they would protect me from her but I highly doubt that. There was this “incident” I guess I should call it where I was told I told two people to off themselves in a call in late December. I had not done that nor been on a call with them until February the next year. I was called names by one of my “friends” who defended the two boys and later unfriended me. The two boys who I apparently told to “off themselves” turned everyone against me. I cried for a while and was suicidal.

My grades were really bad that year and I somehow made it through to the end of year. My grades went up to pretty okay by last June.

In elementary when I was being bullied, I had one friend. He passed away that year at 6 years old from heart disease and his birthday was three days ago. I had a friend in fourth grade who ended up moving away. 

I hit high school and everything seemed okay with me finally being who I am and being able to make some good friends. The only issue is, I am somehow physically unable to cry. I don’t know why. It could be my Zoloft that I’m on (anti-depressant) but I’m really not sure.

For 10 months we were ""together"" trying to figure out how for her to leave her bad marriage. She told me all the time how horrible her husband is and how she wanted to live life with me. She came clean about a month ago to her husband, telling him about me. He guilted her into staying. Saying she disobeyed God and him and now she owes it to him to stay. Well she continued to tell me she believes God will let her leave someday. I found out tonight her husband told her to leave. Literally got a suitcase and put it in front of her, only for her to decide to stay. She has also gone back to sleeping with him. But in the emails she was telling me these things she was also saying how she continues to pray everyday for God to bring us together. I don't know what to do. Her husband threatened to put a restraining order on me. I feel so guilty and also at the same time so hurt by the constant back and forth ""I believe we will be together, I need to stay.""

4695,"Today was tough…. I woke up feeling so tired… Not tired as in sleepy but just tired of life. (not suicidal at all just FYI) I went for a drive to try to clear my head and had to call my mom. She knew immediately something was up and when she asked if I was okay, I just fucking lost it. I have not cried that much in a very long time nor has someone asked me recently if I was okay. 

I’ve been struggling mentally, emotionally and financially since the lock down and since haven’t been able to recover. I wake up and just want to give up every single day. I’m tired, have no motivation, don’t want to talk or see anyone and just feel like I’m lost. I try to find work but can’t get myself to gain the courage to go to interviews or anything, it’s like my body is giving up and I have no idea why. I can’t even fold my laundry or put it away let alone basic things like cooking or cleaning.. Maybe the year without work, constant lock down orders and so much death around fucked me up? 🤷🏼‍♂️

I’m beyond depressed and just feel like I’m not going anywhere in life; I never expected my mid 20s to be this hard.. I miss the good old days where we never gave a fuck and just lived our lives.. no worries, barely any bills, staying up late and just making memories. 

Anyone else feel like this? Any tips on how to get back into the real world? I have ADHD  majorly and don’t think that helps the depression either 😅

4757,"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I’m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years I’ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we don’t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I’m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I’ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn’t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it’s been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I can’t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I’d be scared someone would find out, I’m scared I’d break down, I’m scared I’d lose my place in college.

I’ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections.

4774,"Just looking for some support.I've attempted suicide once, unsuccessfully, and actually for a bit afterwords felt like I made the wrong choice and deserved to stay alive. These days I just feel empty though, and I feel like I'm sleepwalking through my life. It's kind of funny that today is the cake day of this account, I guess it really must be something about this time of year. Fuck spring I guess.

I've been really terribly depressed and I don't feel like I'm going to be able to claw my way out of this for a while. I don't know if I'm going to even graduate anymore as my second semester grades have reached a rock bottom. I used to be an A and B, very occasional C student, but currently I have two F's, one D, and C's across the board elsewhere. Even if I do pull things up I don't think that the college I was admitted to will still allow me to enroll, as I'm fairly certain this big of a plummet in grades will result in a rescinding of my admission. I had my senior recital last Tuesday, a show I spent months practicing for, but got so anxious once I got on stage that I had to stop halfway through my set because I was butchering every song and walked off stage in tears. I've started having behavioral problems because I just feel angry and want to act on it which led to me getting my first behavioral referral due to me calling out a teacher on Facebook and being reported for it, my friends use me for my car and my money and stop hanging out with me when I cut them off but I'm so desperate for interaction that I keep them around. My parents are disappointed and worried, I can't find success in any of things I want to be good at and I'm really not sure what I'm doing anymore. I think I'm going to kill myself soon, I just don't know how. I really wish my life wasn't a perpetual cycle of shitty days.",1,looking supportive attempted suicide unsuccessfully actually bit afterwords felt like wrong choice deserved stay alive days feel thought feel like im sleepwalking life kind funny today cake day account guess time years fuck spring guess ive terribly depressed dont feel like im going able claw way dont know im going graduate anymore second semester grades reached rock occasional student currently fast cos board pull things dont think college admitted allow enroll im fairly certain big plummet grades result rescinding admission senior recital tuesdays spent months practicing got anious got stage stop halfway set butchering song walked stage tears ive started having behavioral problems feel angry want act led getting behavioral referral calling teacher facebook reported friends use car money stop hanging cut im desperate interaction parents disappointed worried cant find success things want good im sure im anymore think im going kill soon dont know wish life wasnt perpetual cycle shitty days

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

Wow, lengthy. Sorry. Should I take English 3 over summer school for less stress and the ability to keep my favorite class, or should I drop choir and just suffer through AP Lang?

4851,"Okay bois, so I need to know if a plan of mine will work So, where do I begin? (From the begining, I know) but, It's kinda a long story, so I will try to make it as short as possible.

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know ¨I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too young¨ (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",0,okay bois need know plan work begin begining know kinda long story try short possible little e broke early september belive went whatsapp group friend met girl fell love days passed dating turns talks +18 stuff mom kinda little bot religious saw conversations +18 stuff took away phone killed beacuse know shouldnt thining kind stuff beacuse young alto e friends talk +18 stuff got nudes girl wanna clear glass block glass block minecraft know risk online dating beacuse know screen isnt beautyfull yo girl instead yo guy called chuck eventually convince meet dumpster 300am kidnap eventually sell kidneys dark web buti know perfectly says beacuse sent photos eachother phone calls thought videocalls weeks passed couldnt found old phone installed messenger went beacuse love understood deserted supported fast forward like days ago mom found talking took phone away yes talking +18 stuff frequently insulted didnt read supported saw time told love body low selfsteem fun wont listen try tell horny teenagers title runs mother told therapy later months know wont listen listen therapist right moment comes talk basically judge book cover realise isnt think ink work think

However, I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression.  This whole year I was going consistently, and it’s helped a lot. 
In the past three weeks, I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails, and I had no energy. 

I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment, and she finally got back to me telling me that she’s going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency. 

I’m really crushed and just broken down because of this.  My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months, but now I would say I’m at a 9.2/10 in terms of wanting to end it.

4879,"Just exhausted of continually feeling this way, and it's not bound to get any better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following:  
* Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway
* Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
* Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
* Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
* Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
* A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches
* Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt
* Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  

I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring.  

I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day.",1,ehausted continually feeling way bound betterthe past 6 months incredibly tumultuous time time thats passed ive eperienced following eperienced end adult love leaving self esteem shambles point believe insane love like theyd find flaws nitpick leave lost majority friends ones remained far away busy living lives point ive reluctant reach didnt graduate college barely got found neckdeep student loan debt moved home entire family eperience father overseas job order ends meet mother constantly yelling reason gotten point dont want leave room avoid fanatic hounding got time job basically puts degree generally work graveyard hours barely sleep constantly stiff neck upper area caused stress lead painful frequent headaches basically having graduate school order pursue profession college major require accumulate student loan debt eperiencing things having general feeling hopelessness day point dont want deal anymore im tired cant getting better idea suicide crossing mind february start snowballing happened time passed started leaning quietly research putting fake smile time leave house shutting room soon got home etent want avoid family great skip meals wont ends way mother nagging eaggerating circumstances dont individuals deem close talk worries group closest high school friends country busy careers feel like ive regressed moving home university getting time job requires degree start paying seemingly endless loans want education prospect having borrow money greatly deterring university gpa severely lackluster way barely stumbled finish line graduate spring think im breaking point dont know dont want tolerate anymore know im younger end spectrum theres unknown thats waiting honestly feel like burdens going following matter path life choose ehausting motivating having deal hate think easy way point dont want deal pain depression stress cycle moment day

Their reaction could've a drastic impact on me. I don't expect that they have feelings for me too, I just want to stay friends with them but I can't hold this ""secret"" inside of me any longer.

I'm scared. Not because of the rejection itself, but because of how I will deal with the pain that comes with it. I'm scared that I'll do something stupid (doesn't even have to be suicide). I don't feel that I'm in control of myself anymore.

It's 8 am where I live right now and I need to get out of bed soon. I have stuff to do. But I can't get the thought of my head that this day will be the final nail for me... it makes me not want to get out of bed.

5042,"When I was in college, I struggled with reading several pages consecutively due to how depressed I became. It was tolerable enough to memorize a powerpoint or read a subsection of a textbook; however, it was almost impossible to read several pages of a textbook or read and complete a novel of some sort. Post college, it became severelyyyy worse. It was hard to read more than two chapters of a book or so without taking a few breaks, and reading long passages in long graduate standardized exams gave me panic attacks. Fast forward to now, I decided to pick up on a few college classes as a career changer, as I avoided my initial desired career due to this fear of unable to reason and read difficult material as necessary as the track would be. I have been able to read so much more clearly. I can't tell if this clarity is due to overcoming some trauma that I had reopened and rectified, the amount of practice I've been doing, and/or the fact that I took a break from school and now am back in taking classes again. 

When I was in college, I valued school so much to the brink of depression. It wasn't helpful but it was necessary for me to put in a lot of time in the stuff I was learning, moreso than others, due to the fact that I struggled with reading and critical thinking while depressed. When I graduated, I felt like i could not do either. School was literally everything to me.....ofc now I realized it shouldn't have been that way. It was just way worse. Panic attacks and being unmedicated everywhere. Now that i've resumed school, everything is suddenly clear and it's so shocking that im writing this post. the impact of the panic attacks and gad and whatever was going on (ptsd idk) was terrible in my life. I just feel like I woke up from a coma from such depression. Still unmedicated too.

5075,"I don’t like attention, or trying to get someone to “care” . I’m pretty independent and it’s relative because this is somewhat out of my comfort zone to even post something like this, I don’t like discussing my problems and am a master of masking. No one even knows how I’m feeling, mainly Becuase I haven’t spoken to my dad in 4 months and my mom believes anything can be changed with the power of mindset and manifestation. Which is utter bullshit because if that was the case I wouldn’t be like this. The downward spiral in the past 4 months is due to a fight me and my father got into, and it still is just as bad as it was a while ago. He’s very manipulative, impossible to please, high standards, strict. He’s a military man. And this causes a lot of issues in the household, and for context my parents are divorced. He holds things over my head financially, and uses it as a control mechanism. He is unbelievably controlling, and interacting with him feels so detrimental to my mental health, but everyone in my family says I can’t just cut him off. Anyways, on to the point I’ve been living at my moms for a few months now and despite the long distance controlling hes been trying to do I’ve been enjoying living here, which is nice. The problem is my mental state has sharply declined in the past few weeks and it gets worse every day. 

I feel like breathing, getting out of bed and going somewhere is a chore that I despise doing. Especially the breathing part. I have not nor will I consider suicide as I don’t find it logical, but that’s just me. Instead I’ve been doing some questionable things because I want to die but like, I don’t wanna kill myself. I wish someone would just rob me at gunpoint and shoot me or something. I can’t take the pain that is literally waking up because it feels like such a big weight on my shoulders. To be honest I don’t even have a main reason for feeling this way, some say it’s their job , their dead end lives, a girl/boy, love, all of that, but I just don’t feel anymore. I used to accelerate and close my eyes in the car as a joke with friends but now I do it almost every time I get into the car, just hoping that I will be taken someday. I can’t even cry or feel anything and I forgot how to smile or frown. I just sit there, with a blank stare. Trying to pass time or counting the seconds in my head. If I had to pin point a reason for feeling this way I’d say the best comparison is like, stress to a insane degree.. is that a thing? I’m just so stressed about everything and anything these days and I’m so out of it that I eat like one meal a day *if I remember* and all I want is to feel alive again and not have to worry about trying to die from some statistic every day. This isn’t necessarily a cry for help. I just don’t know where to put this. So here it is. I apologize if this is a little all over the place, I have trouble putting big thoughts on paper.",1,dont like attention trying care im pretty independent relative somewhat comfort zone post like dont like discussing problems master masking knows im feeling mainly becuase havent spoken dad 4 months mom believes changed power mindset manifestation utter bullshit case wouldnt like downward spiral past 4 months fight father got bad ago hes manipulative impossible high standards strict hes military man causes lot issues household contet parents divorced holds things head financially uses control mechanism unbelievably controlling interacting feels detrimental mental health family says cant cut anyways point ive living moms months despite long distance controlling hes trying ive enjoying living nice problem mental state sharply declined past weeks gets worse day feel like breathing getting bed going chore despise especially breathing consider suicide dont find logical thats instead ive questionable things want die like dont wanna kill wish rob gunpoint shoot cant pain literally waking feels like big weight shoulders honest dont main reason feeling way job dead end lives girl boy love dont feel anymore accelerate close eyes car joke friends time care hoping taken someday cant cry feel forgot smile frown sit blank stare trying pass time counting seconds head pin point reason feeling way id best comparison like stress insane degrees thing im stressed days im eat like meal day remember want feel alive worry trying die statistic day isnt necessarily cry help dont know apologize little place trouble putting big thoughts paper

5104,"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

5117,"So I think I have depression.
It’s been a while since I’ve written a note like this, last time being back in sophomore year; I remember abi rummaged through my phone and found them. So I think I have depression. I’m ready to admit that. It’s been this way since sophomore year, at least that’s what I remember. I’m the cause of it which is why I don’t seek treatment nor diagnoses from a doctor. I don’t have the balls to hear him make it official nor do I want to kill my psyche with a bunch of pills. I also like to think this madness fuels my creativity. It’s an extension of my craving for escapism, only difference being that creativity is much more productive and is seen as a positive attribute. Why do I think I’m depressed? Well to start, I used to write notes like this all the time in sophomore year. Albeit, the subject matter was much darker. All I would write about was about how much I hated this and that and how I wished this and that. A lot of sulking and self-loathing. In junior year it reached its peak as I started to develop something similar to a bi-polar disorder. I would breakdown in my tub, bathing in my tears and self-pity. I would be very sad for a period of about 4 days or so, but then I would be very happy for the next 3 or so days, and so on and so forth. Very weird. I would get a rush of dopamine followed by an intense lack of it, perpetually. Now it’s become a passive thing which is harder to notice but it’s there. It’s hard to get out of bed every day. The majority of the days I shower sitting down lacking the strength or will to stand. Recently it’s become a 50/50 split, but previously I’d sit in the shower everyday. Sometimes I’d even lay down. Sometimes I’d even shower with the lights off. Sometimes I’d even shower in silence. Sometimes I wouldn’t shower, I wouldn’t brush my teeth, I wouldn’t groom, and I wouldn’t clean my room. I’d feel awfully sluggish and lack motivation, then again this is nothing new. It’s the sinking feeling I’ve felt for the last couple years now. Luckily, I don’t experience any suicidal thoughts. I think that’s a bit of an anomaly but I’ll run with it. The reason being: I have dreams I wish to accomplish. That’s been enough to push me forward, yet not enough to motivate me. And that in it of itself adds to the sadness I feel. Not only do I feel insecure and lack self confidence, but I tend to bash myself because of my lack of progress. I feel as if I’m not doing enough to accomplish my goals. I’m constantly thinking that I can do more. I should be doing more. But I don’t. I don’t. During quarantine back in April, I was the happiest I had ever been. It’s not the momentary bliss you feel when you go out with friends, nor the rush of dopamine you feel after a milestone. It was contentment. Not the contentment you feel as you fall into a cycle, but the content you feel with progress. I was happy with the way I was going and my everyday actions. Imagine the sinking feeling turned to a floating feeling. How did I achieve this? Why have I fallen from this grace? Well, it’s all connected. I would complete my goals for the day, in turn that would make me happy with the day, this happiness would then boost my self esteem and confidence, then I’d feel motivated, this motivation would help me accomplish my goals, and so on and so forth. But now I lack motivation, my lack of motivation keeps me from completing my goals, not completing my goals makes me feel inadequate and worthless, then I lose motivation. I know I can break the cycle because I’ve done it before. But it’s hard. It’s possible. But it’s hard. Speaking upon it makes it sound easy, but living day by day, it’s hard. The momentary temptations can overwhelm me. I lack self control. My thoughts often work against me. I begin a goal or project, whatever it may be, but I’ll give up on it without following through. I have these bursts of motivation and creativity on occasion. They’re only that. Bursts. I may take advantage of them but I run out of fuel before I can reach my destination. I know what I must do. I just need to do it. Once I start the positive cycle it’ll begin to snowball and maintain itself. The only way to take it is day by day. Everyday I need to be victorious over myself. I don’t like saying I’m depressed because it’s a word of defeat. I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to die. It’s not like I enjoy this feeling. So I don’t get to use it as an excuse. Deep down I know my reasons for being where I am emotionally and mentally. I need to get off my ass and fix it. I got this. Just day by day, remember the things you want and the very rewarding outcome that awaits in the long run.",1,think depression ive written note like time sophomore years remember abi rummaged phone found think depression im ready admit way sophomore years thats remember im cause dont seek treatment diagnoses doctor dont balls hear official want kill psyche bunch pills like think madness fuels creativity etension craving escapism difference creativity productive seen positive attributed think im depressed start write notes like time sophomore years albeit subject matter darker write hated wished lot sulking selfloathing junior year reached peak started develop similar bipolar disorder breakdown tube bathing tears selfpity sad period 4 days happy net 3 days forth weird rush dopamine followed intense lack perpetually passive thing harder notice hard bed day majority days shower sitting lacking strength stand recently 50 50 split previously id sit shower everyday id lay id shower lights id shower silence wouldnt shower wouldnt brush teeth wouldnt groom wouldnt clean room id feel awfully sluggish lack motivation new sinking feeling ive felt couple years luckily dont eperience suicidal thoughts think thats bit anomaly ill run reason dreams wish accomplish thats push forward motivate adds sadness feel feel insecure lack self confidence tend bash lack progress feel im accomplish goals im constantly thinking dont dont quarantine april happiest momentary bliss feel friends rush dopamine feel milestone contentment contentment feel fall cycle content feel progress happy way going everyday actions imagine sinking feeling turned floating feeling achieve fallen grace connected complete goals day turn happy day happiness boost self esteem confidence id feel motivated motivation help accomplish goals forth lack motivation lack motivation keeps completing goals completing goals makes feel inadequate worthless lose motivation know break cycle ive hard possible hard speaking makes sound easy living day day hard momentary temptations overwhelm lack self control thoughts work begin goal project ill following bursts motivation creativity occasion theyre bursts advantage run fuel reach destination know need start positive cycle itll begin snowball maintain way day day everyday need victorious dont like saying im depressed word defeat dont want dont want die like enjoy feeling dont use ecuse deep know reasons emotionally mentally need ass fi got day day remember things want rewarding outcome awaits long run

5122,"I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety basically forever. My mom used to tell me I had said I wanted to die before I even started school. 

So as these things go, it only got worse. Really, really severe depression. When I turned 21, I finally started therapy and taking antidepressants. So I’ve been doing therapy since then and in addition have tried antidepressants. I’ve currently been on the same one for about a year, but I’ve tried two others. They take depression from something really severe to moderate and mild levels. 
This is all old news. 

But here’s what confuses me:
I kind of realize I go through periods of depression whether I’m on antidepressants or not. So for a month or two maybe, I’ll feel awful. But then it’s as if one day, I just sort of snap out of it… and for a month or two I feel fine again. Not manic, not tons of energy, just relatively normal. 

The antidepressants seem to help the severity of the depressive episodes and perhaps even the length of time, but it doesn’t actually make the episodes go away. 

It’s a trend I just sort of started to notice. I will bring it to my psychiatrist later, but I’m wondering if anyone else has this experience?",1,ive struggled depression aniety basically forever mom tell said wanted die started school things got got worse severe depression turned 21 finally started therapy taking antidepressants ive therapy addition tried antidepressants ive currently years ive tried depression severe moderate mild levels old news heres confuses kind realize periods depression im antidepressants month maybe ill feel awful day sort snap month feel fine manic tons energy relatively normal antidepressants help severity depressive episodes length time doesnt actually episodes away trend sort started notice bring psychiatrist later im wondering eperience

5124,"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

---
I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

If the text seems off it's my fault as my English is not so great as I think.

It’s gotten better, but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time. The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead, mourning me and my choices, is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations. Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. I’m actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I don’t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and I’m getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but I’m wondering who’s battle is this actually? I’m definitely not fighting for myself anymore.

That's all I want is a job that pays me a decent, living wage but I have to get in mounds of debt just to get the tentative possibility of getting one. I asked my advisor if there's something I can do to expedite this so I can get done quickly. She basically just implied I'm lazy and stupid. How am I lazy when I work 6 days a week and have to go to school on the side? How am I stupid when I just don't want  to waste time on impractical information? After all, it's a fact that the human brain prunes information that it doesn't regularly use. Anyway, why shouldn't education in the digital age be tailored to the needs of the individual so we don't have to be encumbered by exorbitant tuition costs?

You either become a willing participant in the game of oppression and learn to take joy in the oppression and suffering of others, or you become a cruel but ignorant slave to the game not realizing how much you’re also being oppressed while stepping on the toes of those who happen to still be below you, or you keep your empathy and refuse to participate but ultimately suffer in a world that wasn’t designed for you to have feelings or goodwill toward others. 

For a long time it made me wish I was dead. Because I do feel empathy and the thought that so many, like me, are just constantly suffering hurts too much. 

Then things got slightly better in my life. Found a person I actively love and love me back. Reconnected with some family and have a better support system for the most part. I don’t personally want to die, at least right now.

But now I just feel more angry. 
Day in and day out of seeing so many people just constantly suffer while the rest actively create, or passively allow, the suffering.

Those people make me so angry. They make me wish, for a moment at least, that *they* were dead. That we could just take every narcissist and psychopath that actively keeps making this world a worse place and just wipe them off the face of the earth forever. That *I* could personally wipe them off the face of the earth. 

But that’s wrong. And dark. And ultimately reductive and childish because I understand there really isn’t a way to stop people from being this way in the first place even if they were somehow magically erased. So evil would still persist regardless. 

I don’t actually want to hurt people. I dislike violence. I dislike the thought of pain for myself or for others. 

I’m just having a hard time grappling with the idea that there is now a part of me that is actively, and more consistently, wishing harm on other people, even if it is in unrealistic and fantastical fashion.

I’m just really angry all the time and it frightens me what that anger can make me think, especially when I know the thoughts are wrong and they make me ultimately feel worse about myself and what kind of person that means I am.

I tired of being angry and sad. I just want to be happy again. 

I do feel better writing this all out somehow. 

Thanks to anyone who reads it even if they don’t reply. Guess I just want to throw it out there so if anyone has ever felt similarly they won’t feel so alone.

Just like the title says I just was prescribed an anti-depressant for the first time by my doctor that also works as an anti-anxiety. I’ve been going through a lot lately, and I do get pretty anxious all the time and I guess I would describe myself as depressed because there are times where I just want to cry and feel like I can’t do anything. 

My concern here is that since I never went to a psychologist/psychiatrist before am I actually depressed? Because I don’t feel the overwhelming dread that a lot of people seem to feel but there are days where it feels pretty bad but I think in general it’s more anxiety. Does anyone else feel like this? Is this a normal thing? Is this a normal way to get prescribed Escitalopram?",1,hello like title says prescribed antidepressant time doctor works antianiety ive going lot lately pretty anious time guess describe depressed times want cry feel like cant concern went psychologist psychiatrist actually depressed dont feel overwhelming dread lot people feel days feels pretty bad think general aniety feel like normal thing normal way prescribed escitalopram

5220,"Quite a bit of a rant... but I really just need to express myself, and hopefully get some kind of help or motivaional suggestions.

TL;DR Started feeling depressed at 4, got worse and worse for a couple years, but then I started to feel okay for a little while and now I'm feeling worse than ever before.. Would love some help or tips to get by easier!

So... I started feeling kind of depressed with anxiety attacks here and there at the age of about 14, honestly don't even know why...

Then about a year later I realized why, existential crisis. I struggled for about 4 years with that and never really came to a conclusion of stuff like: why do we exist; why are the time we spend here fleeting and irrelevant; what's the point of even living this pointless existence when whatever we do we can't avoid the unavoidable death. I just couldn't find any happiness anymore, it was like I was dead inside... Sure, some very temporary moments made me laugh but it wasn't happiness really. I even tried overdosing(but my friends managed to stop me), I tried to slit my wrist but didn't get deep enough.

At the age of about 18 I started doing drugs, and that ""helped"" as a temporary solution for about 6 years. But then I was required to stop for various reasons. And when I got sober, ALL of those previous depression reasons hit me like a train and I fell so deep in to that ""hole"" that I just couldn't ever possibly see myself getting out.

But then a bit over half a year ago I came to the conclusion that: yes althought it might be pointless in the end, life is fleeting and precious, we only got one chance at doing the best of our lifes. After that I have been feeling pretty okay, but all those thoughts have still been gnawing at me in the back my head.

And that brings us to today, as I said I had been feeling okay. But then for some reason EVERYTHING just crashing down on me... Sure I have been having fun writing my own programs, sure I have been able to enjoy movies/shows, sure I love cooking food and playing games.

But it just does not fucking matter, no matter what I do, nor anyone else for that matter. Heat death will cause ALL life, and it's creations, to not matter... At all... No matter how you look at it, everything is pointless, not matters...

If you read this far, thank you for reading and sorry to end on such a sad note, but that is what I'm struggling with rn...

5286,"I want to put my family through this.I am 23 years old and my entire family (four siblings and my mom) stopped talking to me last month. They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks. Or do what they say after they betrayed me like that. I think what my family did to me and is doing to me now is disgusting, it fills me with rage and sadness because I also feel like at this point I can't (and shouldn't) ever forgive them. They will never apologize and I don't see how that gets fixed without an apology. I have all the criteria for suicide and have been suicidal in the past, I can't believe they are abandoning me like this it puts me at a higher risk for suicide and I wish I would do it just to make them feel bad. Just to get them to see the seriousness of the situation. I'd love to post on facebook that the decision was made because on top of feeling like I have nothing left to live for and feeling like I can't cope with my pyschiatric issues anymore (or the side effects of the medications) my family doesn't care what happens to me either so what's the point?

I just want to genuinely feel happy, feel proud of myself, feel like I accomplished something. I skipped my own Master’s graduation because I didn’t feel like I deserved it, and I didn’t deserve it. I could have preformed so much better, worked so much harder if I wasn’t wallowing in my depression all the time.

My parents suggested I apply for a study where they use LSD/mushrooms to help with depression. I’m already taking 10 pills a day and it can help me get off medicine forever. But I’m scared, even if the study works I’m still going to be a loser. 

I haven’t been able to find work since I graduated and it’s killing me, I even got a certification on top of my degree to show that I’m capable but, still, nothing.

Today, I’m alone, wife said she’s done (this time she meant it), friends are all long gone, completely broke, fought with everyone and everything to the point no one can really stand me much and quite frankly I can’t stand anyone either.

The surgery was to correct an overbite, however she feels her jaw now looks like a man. She’s also having an identity crisis because she just doesn’t look like her. She can’t stand to look at herself and She covered up every mirror in the house. She has guilt that she spent 19000 CAD on something she hates. She regrets the surgery so much. A reversal surgery is an option, however the soft tissues may never go back, she risks losing feeling in her face and it’s not guaranteed to look like “her” again. It will also cost another 9,000 CAD.  

My sister hasn’t been well most of her life, she’s being trying to commit suicide since she was 12 years old. Before this surgery, she was upset with her boyfriend and before that her job and before that school, etc. She’s 30 now. But this go around it’s become so hopeless. She just doesn’t see a way out of her despair. 

She has attempted suicide several times over her face:
1. Tried to jump off a bridge
2. Tried to drown herself
3. Tried to cut herself
4. Ordered helium online to gas herself
5. Bought a hose to attach to her exhaust and feed in through her car window. 
6. Swallowed 100 pills. All of her medications. This one happened today. 

Every time it’s been a miracle she hasn’t died. Every time we bring her to the hospital she is let out within 24 hours. The longest she stayed was a week. It’s really tearing our family apart as none of us know how to handle any of this. I’m so afraid she’s going to die. I live every day in complete fear that any phone call I get is the one where they tell me she’s gone. I’m doing everything I think I can to make her want to live. I’m struggling with the weight of it. I’m so lost. How can I make the doctors keep her in there for longer than a day? I feel so guilty over this. If I’m doing enough. If I’m doing the right things. The only times I’m not panicking is when she’s in the hospital because I know she’s safe.

5367,"For everyone who came here looking for help.This is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days, yes we all know, one of THOSE days. Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking ""risks"" and with risks comes ""reward"". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.

I would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?.....  How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being ""unhappy""? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being ""unhappy"" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. 

Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be ""unhappy"" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being ""unhappy"" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you ""happy"". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far.  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, ""happiness"". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle.

5368,"I've been struggling with disordered eating and self-harm for about 6 years now, maybe a little longer. When I was 12 I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and autism. It's been 5 years since then and I've been re-diagnosed with GAD, Clinical Depression, impulsive ADHD, and ASD. My therapist said I could have C-PTSD but I believe I have self-destructive type BPD. I recently moved across the country and it's been stressful, it seems like my intrusive thoughts have been getting worse. Usually, my intrusive thoughts are just self-loathing, (ex: ""This is why your partner hates you"", ""you're such a horrible person"", ""you don't deserve to eat"", and many more...) but today I was washing dishes and one of the last pieces of cutlery I washed was the sharpest knife in the house. The light hit my wrist in a way that made my veins stick out more than usual and I could barely stop myself from slitting my wrist. I needed a second before I could finish doing the dishes and I was so exhausted and depressed afterward I haven't been able to bring myself to eat anything since. I've only been eating very small amounts recently, it's so hard for me to eat. I need to eat specific portions on specific plates, I need equal parts water and food, the food needs to be perfectly portioned or I start panicking. last night I cut up a chicken patty and made rice and I needed to eat all of the rice and chicken at the same time. there was extra rice and no more chicken and I was on edge for the next few hours. and I need to immediately exercise all of my calories off or I feel like purging.

5439,"I used to be a push over.

I let friends bully me back then because for them it was an inside joke and it was just a friendly joke for them.

But ever since quarantine started, i felt so lonely. I was home alone 24/7 and I didnt have anyone to talk to. I talked to my friends occasionaly but i could tell they got annoyed with me.

Eventually i got a boyfriend. They made fun of me for it and often joked about how we were not going to official and if we were, it was not going to last. Eventually i stopped talking to them.

After a few months i invited them to play on my minecraft server. We played but one of my boyfriend's friend got uncomfortable because one of them was making sexual comments about him. Basically sexual harrasment. I only found out a few months after and decided to confront my friend about it. In response, she said: ""snowflake"". I was furious. 

I said to her: ""dick and drugs changed you huh?""

She got mad and blocked me. A friend of ours mssged me telling me she just got overwhelmed as she was experiencing problems at home. And i was confused because that still doesnt explain the snowflake part.

Since then i lost friends. All of them stopped talking to me and sided with her. I get why, they were closer to her. One of my friends that i loved hanging out with blocked me on all social media.

So i only really had my boyfriend and his friends.

Me and my boyfriend used to call 24/7 until he told me he wanted to just call time to time instead of 24/7 because he needed alone time. I agreed and now we are not on call.

Im lonely. I have no social life. I dont have friends, his friends ony talk to me if they want someone to play with, and my family doesnt like me that much. I struggle to make emotional connections with anyone due to my depression and ptsd (family trauma).

I now just live alone, waiting for class to start, eating fish on my bed, staring at the wall, with nothing to do. No hobbies. No interest. No one to be with. Just sitting and waiting until my boyfriend calls.",1,push let friends bully inside joke friendly joke quarantine started felt lonely home 24 7 didnt talk talked friends occasionally tell got annoyed eventually got boyfriend fun joked going official going eventually stopped talking months invited play minecraft server played boyfriends friend got uncomfortable making seual comments basically seual harrassment found months decided confront friend response said snowflake furious said dick drugs changed huh got mad blocked friend missed telling got overwhelmed eperiencing problems home confused doesnt eplain snowflake lost friends stopped talking sided closer friends loved hanging blocked social media boyfriend friends boyfriend 24 7 told wanted time time instead 24 7 needed time agreed im lonely social life dont friends friends ony talk want play family doesnt like struggle emotional connections depression family trauma live waiting class start eating fish bed staring wall hobbies interest sitting waiting boyfriend calls

5454,"I have friends who say that they love themselves, that they think they're attractive and worthwhile. And when they say that, all I can think is how, how can someone love themselves or even think of themselves positively. I can barely think of one major positive thing about myself. I have hated myself ever since I was 9 and it has never let up for the past decade.

My self hatred is so engrained that when friends or family tell me something positive about me, it's like my mind completely blocks it out, and it's even worse when I get into a depressive headspace. Because I believe that they're lying or they're saying so out of pity and they don't mean it. Positive self talk feels wrong on every level and I need constant validation for everything.

I look at my body and all I can see is what's wrong with it and how ugly it is. I reflect on myself and all I see is weakness, slobishness, selfishness, stupidity and inadequacy. I look at all the skills I've acquired and all I see is a string of failures, and again, inadequacies. I'm bad at everything I do. I'm constantly scared that my friends are going to find someone better and replace me with them so whenever I feel threatened in that way I act out and make things worse.

I'm super weak and I know that. I know I don't deserve anything good in this life and I know that I'm fat, ugly, and undesirable. And I know this mindset just makes it worse by the day but at this point its grown so dark and powerful that I can't stop it. I'm too weak to stop it.

I know I need major help, I just dont know where to get it, I just want it to stop.

I mean, although the world is fucked up as it is, I have a thousand reasons to live, a thousand ways of feeling happy and seeing the joy of life, including him, of course. I'm also Buddhist and I also think that there are other ways to seek the end of suffering beyond just death. I don't think there's nothing wrong in suicide per se, especially if you're living a pretty shitty life, but obvously I don't want that to happen, and I spend the day worrying that it will happen. I'm surrounded by depressed people (friends, family) so I know the basics of dealing with it, but having a person so close to me so gravely depressed is making me lose any references I thought I had, and honestly making me feel somehow depressed as well, since I don't see how could I be of any help.

5491,"Confusion, suicide and a sick petI’ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. It’s different this time though because I truly feel I’m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it’s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn’t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I can’t trust my own brain, my mind. It’s the worst it’s ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. He’s going downhill and the doctors just figured out what’s going on but the situation is dire it’s probably too late. I don’t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime he’s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well I’m suicidal, I don’t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said it’s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. I’m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I don’t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he’s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless I’m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I don’t know if it’s good for him or me to keep doing this. I don’t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didn’t do everything I could. And I don’t know if that outweighs the anger I’m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isn’t worth it. We could be released from everything.

5539,"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",1,screenwriting course scripts characters commit suicide parts dealing depression ive little low lately matters im long past days moment feels like breathing underwater hurts little wrote outline script year half ago worst throws depression nearly hospitalized class comes basic course finish script like script grown changed certainly broader scope depression haunted today write little character considers committing suicide like seeing actions character voice depression line wrote ideas head like writing thoughts past easy write meant zoom past faster watch script come life traumatic couldnt let people especially people know like know isnt im better feel like cutting stop committing suicide looking edge building sad hesitating wouldnt confused wanted compleity feel like ive epert suicide hospitalization therapy group therapy antidepressants depression class scripts dont right straightforward write straightforward small wants kill larger wants antidepressants means fall depression larger ready cut moments notice stop pain talk script class like opening wound bothers dont think knows right class wasnt clear character accident attempt sounded like suicide attempt guess ill tell theres realistic way hospital day accident asking intent life keeps getting comple farther epicenter depression dont depression getting closer stable thought know long isnt entirely related wanted people know like consider suicide know bit ambiguity treatment reactions follow

Reading posts where guys complain about the impossibility of attracting girls because of their supposed bad looks makes feel even more worthless because I know girls like me. They look at me all the time, I’ve missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like I’m trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also I’m fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and they’re getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me I’m not letting myself go. I’m fighting with all I got. I’ve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist.

My parents are confused as to why I’m just disobeying them and my dad is getting even angrier at me daily. This disobedience has only made them take away things that helped me. And the worse my mental state is the more desperate I am to try to bring it up to even the slightest bit. I don’t have the strength to tell them how bad I’m doing and I can’t afford help even if I could get to it. Talking to my friend has helped a lot but I’m still getting worse everyday.

It was going fine until I got too depressed to even do anything. I'm most likely going to get held back.(I actually got held back before in first grade because I have a learning disability. :/)

I see no hope at all for my future. I'm stupid, very stressed, anxious, I have no irl friends, I lack social skills, I can't do things for myself, and I'm addicted to the internet. My family is emotionally abusive and because of them and bullying is most likely why I have depression in the first place.

Credit: u/potheadboyz


So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's  something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

I could never relate to all you guys saying ""I feel so alone"" or ""I'm depressed"" and I always felt like an outsider in this sense. I mean, I have a great life and I don't like people complaining when they have a great life too!

I won't go into details here (simply because it's boring) but I consider the life I'm leading extremely lucky.

And suddenly it was like a ""welcome to the club"" moment. 

And I always ask myself, *what changed?* Is this a teenager phase that will pass soon? Or is this more... real?

I have no friends other than two guys I met online and never actually met. I can't find myself. I have a beautiful family: but it just feels like they don't know me. I'm constantly bored. And I go on walks everyday just to get out of this life - even if it's just for an hour. And seriously, why? As I said, I have a great life. So what changed?

5649,"I'm a disgusting piece of shit and here is my rant.I'm so fucking done. I recently moved to the other side of the country for my internship, better said: to work fulltime without even getting paid. I have literally nobody here; all my coworkers are at least ten years older (seriously), I can't join any sportsclub or other activities around here cause I'm not an official student so I'm not welcome there. All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. 

Things were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps. I'm still the same disgusting whore, and I don't know what the fuck to do.

5650,"I've had MDD all my life, but for the passed 10 years it's evolved into an extreme Anhedonia, and I'm struggling to find a solution. I don't get any pleasure, motivation, or excitement from anything anymore. I used to have intense desire to draw, play video games, explore, etc. All those motivating feelings stopped as I entered my teen years (I'm now 28). I was on SSRIs as a kid and motivation wasn't an issue. It was mainly for suicidal tendencies and anxiety from my depression. However, since about 15 it's been a steep decline to Anhedonia. 

What I've done. 
I've bounced around all major SSRIs, and combined them with Wellbutrin XL to no avail. 
I've done lifestyle changes where I joined a gym and went at it 4 times a week for a year and gained 30lbs of muscle. 
I would get more sunlight.
Push myself into social gatherings with my best friends. 

Currently I'm back to 40mg prozac, but the only thing it helps is the darkened/suicidal thoughts. I just want to enjoy life again. It's been so long that I've forgotten what it's like.

I woke up later and was like 10 minutes late to my 2nd class but I didn't care because the teacher is pretty annoying and always started the class 5 minutes late anyways so I stayed up for a couple of minutes entered a breakout room and took another like 20 minute nap when I woke up it was time to leave and so I spent lunch in bed and on my phone

After that I got up did my morning stuff then came back to start my second class once that was over I put my dog outside and responded to a bunch of reddit comments I got and the occasional text I then proceeded to scroll through instagram and have a fucking aneurysm over the among us memes I then proceeded to contemplate my existence 

Moving on I played some botw instead of doing work during my fourth class and my mom cam home for lunch brought me some food from a new local mexican restaurant it was pretty good I watched some youtube and ended my last class

It was so fucking cute I swear it looked at me with those cute eyes I was about to cry right there and god I felt so good for the rest of the day. I keep remembering that golden puppy and I feel this warm feeling in my heart. God I just want to hug it forever.

5664,"For all but 2 months of my life I've been depressed and I feel like it will never end.

My parents hit me when I was a kid, they never showed up to any school event where parents where invited, being born on the edge of the school year boundary instead of being kept down like everyother kid I was made to go up a year meaning I was the youngest in my class and thus isolated and never able to keep up both academicly or socially with anyone in my class.

I went to a secondary school more than and hour away, always the last person on the bus and so my social life as a teenager was none existant, because I was always tired from having to wake up early to get to school people always called me a school shooter as a joke and would try to fight me and when ever I beat them up in self defence I was always the one punished despite the school having cctv showing I was the victim. My school cheated and was happy to leave people like me behind and only offered to help to the students who didn't need it, like giving the top of the class top grades students extra time on exams.

Whenever there is a competition I never win, even when I try my hardest, working myself to the bone the winner is either some half baked pity winner or someone with the advantage of having more money, time and connections.

I'm in constant pain with both my wrists hurting all the time, my left side hurting due to complications at birth and the right side for compensating for the left.

I shower and shave, try to look after myself yet even on the most crowded of public transport people don't sit next to me.

At work my coworkers forget about me, despite being 4 of us they only put three chairs and desks for all of us despite being room for 4 and the desks and chairs already existing.

After two years of being in my room all alone I finally worked my ass off to get into uni, and met her. The only girl I've ever had feelings for. I've always wanted to be in a relationship but never found a girl I liked, yet despite her asking me out, despite the fact she said she was happy and had fun with me she chose to just be friends. Even when I tried my hardest and the girl said I did nothing wrong they still left and so there goes the only person I've ever had feelings for.

My entire life I've had everything stacked against me, when I work as hard as I can i never get anymore out of it than if I did nothing. People treat me like an after thought and the only person who made me happy doesn't want to be with me. No matter what I do and try life never gives me a break.

5678,"I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say ""why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?"" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a ""temp to permanent"" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

and i base my self worth on how others reply to me. idk to be silent all the time is better or talk all the time better? i told my self if i speak i might learn from mistakes.

I have been super depressed lately because I just want to go home. This life feels like a dream, all these people around me are just ok with living these sad and boring lives. I am just another person for now and I hate it. I don't fit in with anyone because I don't belong here. Everything around me is wrong, everything is alien to me.

This is literally the only explanation for why I feel the way I do. I have lived before, somewhere else, then was born here. This life is like a middle ground. That's why it all feels so worthless, because part of me knows that when this pointless life is over I can finally go home. This isn't my home, these people aren't my family, these people aren't my friends. Maybe for now, maybe to some extent they are. But in the big picture they aren't. I mean hell, my life is one big show. Im acting the part that I have to act, so that when its all over I can finally be happy.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

5764,"Not sure what to do. My life feels like it's over.Hi I was just directed to this sub.. I'm not even sure where to begin.

I have mental problems/memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I'm sorry.

I'm also sorry for the length of the post. You dont have to read it, it's OK.

I'm 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.

By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 

In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)

5782,"My girlfriend of 7 years just told me it’s over. 

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few months now. And I recently had a bit of a wake up call and started to be proactive about it. I hit what I thought was rock bottom. And I decided I wanted to be happy again. So I’ve bought books, started going to counselling, started taking medication, got back into exercise, I was really trying. I really wanted to get back to being the person I know I am inside. 

But today she told me I’m not enough. The changes I have made aren’t enough. She doesn’t think the future I can offer would be happy enough. 

I know I shouldn’t define my self worth on someone’s opinion. But when you love someone as much as I love her, hearing them tell you all the progress you’ve been making isn’t enough… I am shattered. 

If the person who knows me best on this earth, who has been there for all my highs and lows, if she is looking at me and has decided I can’t be happy enough, why should I keep trying? She knows me better than anyone. I gave her my everything. 

I thought I’d hit rock bottom before I started trying to get better. But now I know what rock bottom actually feels like. 

It’s trying your absolute best. Giving something everything you have. Committing 110% towards a goal. 

To stand in front of a person who is your whole world and be told you are not enough. You are not the choice. You are a shadow to the person who is your sun. 

This is rock bottom. This is where I am now. 

I’m not really sure why I’m posting this. I suppose I just wanted someone to know how I’m feeling.",1,girlfriend 7 years told ive struggling aniety depression months recently bit wake started proactive hit thought rock decided wanted happy ive bought books started going counselling started taking medication got eercise trying wanted person know inside today told im changes arent doesnt think future offer happy know shouldnt define self worth someones opinion love love hearing tell progress youve making isnt shattered person knows best earth highs lows looking decided cant happy trying knows better gave thought id hit rock started trying better know rock actually feels like trying absolute best giving committing 110 goal stand person world told choice shadow person sun rock im sure im posting suppose wanted know im feeling

5869,"BreakupIm 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it. When I was trying to get sober I thought about killing myself a lot for the same reason. All this work to do and no energy. Ive come to the conclusion that doing work, whether for money or personal growth is the way to being ol and somewhat of a whole person but I just dont know how. I have all this work to do and I dont have the energy or give a shit enough about anything to get started. I know objectively what is supposed to work.

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop. I'm currently working on a song for him, It's been a really long writing process but I think it's coming along well.

5928,"I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

5931,"so i dont even know how or where to start this..

ive always been kind of a sad person in general due to mistreatment at home  and i lived with my stepdad who could honestly probably give 2 shits about me but around 14 my mom started using drugs and it really started effecting her like alot... she slowly started losing her mind so we decided to move across the country (closer to my stepdads family) i only got a weeks notice to prepare myself to move out of a place ive lived for my whole life, everything i knew was from my small hometown.. so i had to say goodbye to everyone i knew in a one week span , fast forward to when we finally moved, the first few months we were living with my stepdads mom and stepdad in a 2 bedroom house (we had a family of 5 plus my step dads mom her bf) this did not help the situation with my mom at all she would sit up at night and start talking to herself laughing at absolutely nothing, this definitely did not help my mental state either i was honestly already super depressed but i didnt want to show it to my mom for the sake of her mentality, fast forward again and we get our own house finally and my mom is still getting worse to the point she says she talked to lucifer and stuff and my little sisters were scared of her, especially because my mom was convinced we (me and my siblings) were hacking her phone and putting cameras in the tvs. we tried and tried to make her go get help but she just swore up and down we were out to get her. it was to the point every single night would end in a screaming match with someone in the family, i remember one thing that fucked me up and still really really hurts me is when she said once i turn 18 she doesn't wanna talk to me anymore... so while all this is happening at home its making me so physically and emotionally drained i just didnt have the energy to try in school or even make friends. so after about a year or so of being across the country i couldnt handle being in that house anymore so i moved back with one of my close friends in my original hometown, everything was going ""fine"" until i met this girl (at the time ive never really got into a serious serious commitment) we started talking and had mutual feelings for each other so we started dating, i regret ever doing that she was my 1st true love and she made me care for her alot and made me fall hard only for her to cheat on me not once but 2 times this literally broke me and to this day still haven't even fully recovered, we were together for nearing a year (we did take a break when i found out she was cheating and for some reason blinded by love i got back with her) she found a new guy within about a week and i was once again left alone only having my like 3 friends for support only to get extremely sick and have to miss a week of school straight which ended up making the truant show up at my house and tell me i NEED to go to school (i was a junior) so the next day i went and the teachers sent me to the nurses because i was shaking and trembling during my whole 1st 2nd and 3rd period classes the nurse took my temperature and it was 106 if i remember right which made her start freaking out and they ended up calling the e.r and in all the commotion the school was looking through my files to contact someone and they noticed i did not live with my mom so about 4 days later she comes to my house again and basically tells me im kicked out of the school and i have to go back across the country to live with my mom, this once again really messed me up, i ended up living with my grandma who wasnt too far out of my original hometown so i lived there for about a year or 2 but right before i turned 18 i was randomly kicked out still dont know why but this is where thing really started to go downhill i moved out and was homeless for 2 years switching between my 2 friends houses and staying to avoid sleeping on the streets (crime is really high in my town)  all while all this is happening my mom split up with my stepdad (who she was with my whole life)and moved back in with her dad who wasnt the greatest person to deal with my mom at this point she already had been diagnosed with schizophrenia eventually they got tired of dealing with her so she got kicked out and somehow got the money to move back to visit my sister but my stepdad didnt let her back in and now she too was homeless and at a womans homeless shelter i tried staying in contact with her but it really just hurt to she was a completly different person it was like the person i was talking to wasnt even my mom just a stranger that took my moms body ,she would always ask if i had spare money which i didnt i was flat broke i could barley even get food to eat ,at one point i was around 80 pounds ... do you know how bad it hurts when you cant even help your mom let alone help yourself? (she still asks every now and then but even today im not in a great situation) so my mom just slowly off the grid only messaging me on facebook like once every couple months and moving all over the country which made me worried sick , but after the 2 years i was homeless and i finally got a job with my friend and got my own place with him , it was a very very old trailer and was falling apart but it felt good actually having my own place to stay and not feel like a complete bum. stayed there for about another year and i dont wanna get to into detail but someone else moved in as well and made us both move out , so there i was 19 and homeless once again and i still had no car or license, i was really done trying with everything everyday i woke up wanting to die.. i even tried multiple times but backed out cause i was too scared of making my mom anymore depressed than she was so i kept going so about a month or 2 later we got another place to stay which is the place im at now , i was honestly slowly getting better and trying to be a better person until just recently ... so one of my friends that i stayed with when i was homless has had just as a shitty life as mine if not worse so we were very very close he was like a brother to me , he ended up getting really sick with chron's disease which made him lose a ton of weight (for those who dont know Chron's is a inflammatory bowel disease which heavily affects your diet) he was in and out of the hospital for awhile, i let him stay with me for a few weeks cause he was living with his grandma which was not the best for someone in his condition. everything was fine for the first 2 weeks until one week he started uncontrollably vomiting and would not eat so he would only be awake about 2 hours everyday he ended up going back and later that night got life flighted ..... the hospital he was flighted to was said to be one of the best of the state but apparently they kept overfilling him with fluids.... so he was there for about 2 days until i gotta call from a mutual best friend of mine and his .... he passed due to complete organ faliure due to an infection which couldve easily been prevented.... This was only about 4 days ago i got this news... i dont even know how to handle anything anymore i feel so alone.. he was one of my only friends i could open up to.... i went through so much with him and just like that he was gone... last thing i even said to him was he needs to eat and take his medication...i didnt even get to tell him i loved him.... my mind is always overthinking... my soul is empty... my heart is heavy... i dont see a reason to even keep going",1,dont know start ive kind sad person general mistreatment home lived stepdad honestly probably 2 shits 14 mom started drugs started effecting like alot slowly started losing mind decided country closer stepdad family got weeks notice prepare place ive lived life knew small hometown goodbye knew week span fast forward finally moved months living stepdad mom stepdad 2 bedroom house family 5 plus step dads mom help situation mom sit night start talking laughing absolutely definitely help mental state honestly super depressed didnt want mom sake mentality fast forward house finally mom getting worse point says talked lucifer stuff little sisters scared especially mom convinced siblings hacking phone putting cameras test tried tried help swore point single night end screaming match family remember thing fucked hurts said turn 18 doesnt wanna talk anymore happening home making physically emotionally drained didnt energy try school friends year country couldnt handle house anymore moved close friends original hometown going fine met girl time ive got commitment started talking mutual feelings started dating regret est true love care alot fall hard cheat 2 times literally broke day havent fully recovered nearing year break found cheating reason blinded love got found new guy week left having like 3 friends support etremely sick miss week school straight ended making truant house tell need school junior net day went teachers sent nurses shaking trembling est ord period classes nurse took temperature 106 remember right start freaking ended calling ear commotion school looking files contact noticed live mom 4 days later comes house basically tells im kicked school country live mom messed ended living grandma wasnt far original hometown lived year 2 right turned 18 randomly kicked dont know thing started downhill moved homeless 2 years switching 2 friends houses staying avoid sleeping streets crime high town happening mom split stepdad lifeand moved dad wasnt greatest person deal mom point diagnosed schizophrenia eventually got tired dealing got kicked got money visit sister stepdad didnt let homeless womans homeless shelter tried staying contact hurt completly different person like person talking wasnt mom stranger took moms body ask spare money didnt flat broke barley food eat point 80 pounds know bad hurts cant help mom let help asks today im great situation mom slowly grid messaging facebook like couple months moving country worried sick 2 years homeless finally got job friend got place old trailer falling apart felt good actually having place stay feel like complete bump stayed year dont wanna detail moved 19 homeless car license trying everyday woke wanting die tried multiple times backed cause scared making mom anymore depressed kept going month 2 later got place stay place im honestly slowly getting better trying better person recently friends stayed homeless shitty life worse close like brother ended getting sick chronos disease lose ton weight dont know chronos inflammatory bowel disease heavily affects diet hospital awhile let stay weeks cause living grandma best condition fine 2 weeks week started uncontrollably vomiting eat awake 2 hours everyday ended going later night got life lighted hospital lighted said best state apparently kept overbilling fluids 2 days gotta mutual best friend passed complete organ failure infection couldve easily prevented 4 days ago got news dont know handle anymore feel friends open went like gone thing said needs eat medicationi didnt tell loved mind overthinking soul heart heavy dont reason going

5945,"It's lost to me, how I'm actually expected to be happy. Yesterday I saw some post talking about how life is kind of like a game that everyone plays and it kind of rang true to me. Like we are playing roles and just expected to go about collecting titles, and assets, to check off the boxes of doing life right. Example, school, go to college, meet someone, start a career, get married, have children, buy a house, etc. and that seems fine I guess in theory, and for most people is enough, but I start to go crazy thinking about these things. 

One thing I think about is how my version of the college experience sucked, I'm freaking 31 and still think about this...career is awful, I've spent so much of my adult life focusing so much on work. Work that I don't enjoy, work that I don't care about, work that I only do because someone at one point was able to recommend me when I needed a job and now have a set of skills that basically pigeon hole me directly into only this industry. 

Even the concept of getting away from the traditional sense of corporate work are so annoying. Any time I think about a switch being cool, I think about how that wouldn't work either. The things I enjoy, money would never be what I can make working corporate. Those things then also require an insane amount of work to grow into something potentially awesome, again, more things I don't freaking care about. Example, say I wanted to do photography as a career, regardless of it being a overrun industry, in order to be successful, you have to do not only photos you don't want to do, you also have to then run the business side, doing sales, social media, etc etc etc. Even when I think to my first big passion, music, same thing, you have to do the social media game, pitch things to others, on and on and on. 

While I do understand the concept too that if you love it it doesn't feel like normal ""work"" but its still work and not enjoying life. Enjoying life being something that you also can't do without a lot of money. The times I find myself ""enjoying"" things most is when I can take vacations....yet again, something that requires money to do, meaning you have to work, in my case jobs that suck, in order to earn just barely enough days to ""enjoy life"" for a one week a year if you're lucky. 

I just want to DO things. I like taking photos, its fun, I'm not that good at it but also barely have a chance to focus on it. I like video, I like cooking/baking, I like making and researching coffee, I like music and playing it, but none of these things are also something that I want to do for work, they are just what I'd like to spend my time doing. 

All I want to do is just live. Enjoy life, and actually for once be happy. But instead so much of my life is focused on making some stupid manager happy, doing business for a company that doesn't give a shit about me, trying to remember to be active enough with friends and also find new things to ask friends to do with me. Remembering to post shit on social media that I don't actually care about to keep up some kind of ""image"". Keep my place spotless and looking ""cool"", try to watch enough various things to be interesting and above all, expected to somehow in a time where I meet zero new people in a city I know no one that I moved to last year, find a significant other using all of the above to seem like such a cool option...I'm just so sick of it all. I wake up every day wishing it wasn't a new one having to do everything all over again. Not that I wish I was dead, I don't, I want to be happy so badly, it just seems like any time I am happy it lasts for a max of a few minutes before reality slaps me back in the face again.",1,lost im actually epected happy yesterday saw post talking life kind like game plays kind rang true like playing roles epected collecting titles assets check boes life right eample school college meet start career married children buy house etc fine guess theory people start crazy thinking things thing think version college eperience sucked im freaking 31 think thiscareer awful ive spent adult life focusing work work dont enjoy work dont care work point able recommend needed job set skills basically pigeon hole directly industry concept getting away traditional sense corporate work annoying time think switch cool think wouldnt work things enjoy money working corporate things require insane work grow potentially awesome things dont freaking care eample wanted photography career regardless overrun industry order successful photos dont want run business sales social media etc etc etc think big passion music thing social media game pitch things understand concept love doesnt feel like normal work work enjoying life enjoying life cant lot money times find enjoying things vacationsyet requires money meaning work case jobs suck order earn barely days enjoy life week year youre lucky want things like taking photos fun im good barely chance focus like video like cooking baking like making researching coffee like music playing things want work id like spend time want live enjoy life actually happy instead life focused making stupid manager happy business company doesnt shit trying remember active friends find new things ask friends remembering post shit social media dont actually care kind image place spotless looking cool try watch things interesting epected time meet zero new people city know moved years find significant like cool optionim sick wake day wishing wasnt new having wish dead dont want happy badly like time happy lasts ma minutes reality slaps face

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

5985,"When I was 15 years old, I made a promise to myself that my life would before/by the time I’m 25. It’s been 7 years, meaning technically i have 2 years left. That year was really bad for me. I remembered abuse I’d repressed for 10+ years and attempted suicide. I was insanely lonely. I lived in a foreign country (wasn’t my first, we moved all the time, we kept moving after that too) and my class was very small. Give or take 30 people in my entire high school. 12 of them in my grade, we all knew and studied English but during breaks no one spoke it. No one spoke to me regularly. I took a week off from school after my attempt. When I came back, my homeroom teacher (really really nice man. i wish i told him how much i appreciate him) made a comment about my absence - he asked my classmate nearby and she said she never noticed I was gone. Didnt notice I was gone in a high school of 30 people. 

Since that year I moved 3 times. I’ve been really lonely and I don’t try as much to make friends (90% are online). 2 and a half months before my 18th birthday my mom died. She was abusive, and didnt take care of her illness, so I had to look after her during emergencies as young as 5.

Since then things have gone from bad to worse. 

Now, I’m 22, in a major I feel unsure in (my second lol, I switched a year ago), still very friendless, and at my very very lowest. Lower than when I attempted. 

Since October I lost 50 pounds, but my body is flabby and I experienced a kidney infection and possible nerve damage. Covid has triggered my eating disorder (it was always present but never to the level of a 50 pound loss). I’m not upset about the weight loss, if anything I want to go below my current BMI of 20. I relapsed and self harmed, my biggest scar to date, although I havent done so in a few months. The urges are coming back though lmao wonder why.

I very nearly failed uni this summer. and despite having almost no irl friends, I still manage to ruin relationships around me. I used to think I was a good person as a kid but really I’ve blossomed into a horrible subcategory of a human. 

I just feel like I’m running out of time and that it will only keep getting worse. I’m pretty sure I have a personality disorder but throughout my life both my family and MH professionals have disregarded my words and told me that I am “a hormonal teenage girl”. I’m upset bc if this had been taken care of it woukdnt have festered like  this. 

It took me three months for the healthcare services to take me seriously and set an appointment.

5987,"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
I’m so scared I might do something drastic, I’ve been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore",1,im losthello adam 16 ive struggling years im afraid past years thoughts suicide fear aniety im close limit ive quiet long im scared come family feelings 3 years ago losing aunt triggered everyday feeling hopeless lost guilty remorseful things ive life thoughts like little ive eperienced life time ive revealed feelings family broke saw cuts watching worried portrayed average day feel absolutely dreadful later found attempt survivor attempt od overdose pills attempt hanging happened blackout pills went noose im afraid therapy diagnosed severe depression social aniety eating disorder later transferred fucken group therapy reason feel anious eventually session 1 1 therapy showed results daily check feelings 2 step survey mom dad come find ive putting feeling horrible afraid anious everyday mom ive absolutely amazing described happiest shes seen therapy helped eventually serialize anti aniety anti depression im sorry forgot finished prescription found right type anti depressant mom thought wanted drugs took recommended pill schedule week stopped taking time ive feeling worse afraid damage worry ive caused going im afraid ive ive relapsed cutting developed severe insomnia day day feeling hopeless worthless questioning whats motivation bed going ask nearly night having break everytime help im scared drastic ive shaped fear aniety ink anymore

6016,"Long rant of things I can't say anywhere else.

I'm tired of it. I run an art account and aspiring to be a professional illustrator. It's just ""given"" to socialize on the SNS so your art have more exposure/reach. I'm not funny nor I wanted to be seen as funny in my art account, it's just tiring to an extend having to roleplay this excitement. I'm not excited. I feel sometimes I don't care much about my friends which whom I barely talk to because lack of topic and I have generally shallow relationships with people. Even when I do like something, the excitement is brief. I know it's most likely anhedonia and general depression. I want to care but deep down I don't have the drive, I'm a shallow useless person.

I couldn't talk eloquently about my interest nor I am funny and exciting person. Boorish. Talking feels like a waste as any words seems just fell flat. 

Yes, painting is also a way to communications so I'm trying to be better on that front. But words are more concrete and efficient. If I were to follow my feelings,  it's just mild interest and apathy. 

I really dont get how some people seemingly could give so much love and care so much, even in real life I feel like those aspects of me are missing. Words coming out of my mouth feels like lies, just pleasantries. Maybe I'm just natural born jerk, it feels like I have to force myself to care... I'm not actively suicidal, but it does feel like it's just counting time until I am bound to do it. Even in good days when I am actually doing something, I thought about it.

6018,"Best resource for mental health help for somebody without a lot of money?I've been dealing with the death of my father for about a year and it comes and goes with how well I can actually deal with it.  The past few months have been especially hard for some reason.  I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better).  I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.

**Edit:**  To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating.  I have done all of those things ad nauseum.  I do them regularly.  I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working.  I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond.

6020,"Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. I’m sharing an observation and this isn’t an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and that’s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldn’t usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. I’ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are “normal” (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe I’m reading too far into it but it’s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. It’s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it’s convenient to show that you support an agenda.",0,guys notice commercials shows increased black cast presence notice increase black people commercials television disclaimer african american im sharing observation isnt invitation racist discussion 2020 wild year came racial injustice protests demands change happy proud obviously companies protests come support thats fine shows commercials like pandering genuine desire increase diversity watching paper tower commercial black animated family lot new shows adding number black people cast harvard pledging admit black students commercials wouldnt usually black face great realize lot companies amid protest pertains race ive seen rush diversity instances normal normal meaning huge public outcry racial reform maybe im reading far noticed television companies putting black face star commercial calling progress upsetting companies genuine desire push diversity pushing convenient support agenda

6024,My best friend and I were super close up until Christmas. I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for around 2 years and in September I was told I could not swim anymore due to a shoulder injury. I was a competitive swimmer and I had qualified for Olympic trials so losing this was basically like losing everything I had worked for my entire life. Needless to say my depression and suicidal thoughts got worse until the only time I felt okay was with my best friend. Over the year I started to get into a worse and worse mental state and I guess I became hard to be around or something. Anyways my best friend stopped hanging out with me after Christmas out of nowhere without rly saying anything. I asked to hangout multiple times a week and I know she was busy but it seemed like she never had time for me anymore. Anyways a few weeks ago she told me that our friendship was one sided and that she didn’t want to talk to me as much. I try to ask her if she wants to do stuff and she always just says I’ll let you know and then just never brings it up again. I really don’t want to lose her as a friend she is literally the only thing I have left and she means the world to me. However it has been making me extremely sad ( to the point where I have thought about killing myself multiple times) because of how everything she says to me seems to be upset with me.

6046,"I'm invisibleGranted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings. I've sought therapy and a psych for meds but it seems like they never want to hear the bad or try to ""silver lining"" my struggles by saying I'm so strong....I'm tired, no exhausted, from being so strong.

6052,"So I feel like I've kinda given up. I don't mean that I don't want to be alive or anything like that, but I've given up on all the things that once mattered to me. I was not necessarily a great student or anything, I got B's and A's and the occasional C. But now I'm 19 and a sophomore in college, and I've just been failing so badly. I can't take school seriously since it's all online, and I'm just not able to learn or understand and idk it's tearing me apart because I failed all my classes this spring semester. I thought that coming back home for the summer and taking my classes back here would help but instead I just failed them all over again. I got a summer job and it absolutely killed my mental health, it just helped me dissociate and feel like life was just a game. I literally felt like I was in papa's pizzeria or something and felt customers happiness go down if I didn't act fast enough or if I made a mistake. The amount of times I just wanted to shut down and start crying on the job is once too much, and I just had to quit for my own wellbeing. I told my mom I was depressed, and instead of being understanding, she just yelled at me and said I had nothing to be depressed about and she was depressed with every right to be. I just feel like an absolute failure. I crashed my dad's car, I failed all my classes (twice), I can't even keep a job because I just can't do it. I'm slowly diminishing my savings and I'm supposed to go back on campus late August, and yet it feels like the closer I get to that the more I freak out because I literally don't know if I've flunked out of college yet and I feel like I have and it's just so terrifying. I haven;t talked to anyone about how I've failed my classes again this summer, and it's eating me up. Everyone is trying to be so supportive of me but I just have no drive to do anything. I have no energy, I can't concentrate or sit still to even try and study. I just miss being in a regular setting and maybe I wouldn't try to blame my failures on this online stuff instead of my own mental health or whtever. I tried reaching out to my universities counseling center, yet they said I could only get a session via Zoom if I'd already seen them in person, so I've just been waiting to get back on campus to do so.

6084,"Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk.  I talked about football with this random guy.  I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears.  I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache.  I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life.  I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide.  I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time.  I really could kill myself tonight.  I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying.  Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead.  All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won't exist, it won't effect me, it will be....nothing.  I silently decided, ""ok, I think tonight is the night"".

I stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ""ok you too"", and I left.  My first thought was ""are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to""? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It's all symbolic horse shit that won't mean anything after I'm dead.  It's the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that's never been me, so why should I care.  I left the bar, and just started......walking.  I didn't know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path.  I've never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn't help but find the humor in it.  Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody.  It made me think about how there's probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.

I thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning.  Then I remembered, I already made my choice.  I didn't sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now.  I intended to do what I've known needed to be done since I was 16.

I kept walking, and walking, and walking.  I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window.  I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health.  I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday.  I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun.  I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for.  At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.

I finally reached a highway.  It wasn't like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it.  I'd see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things.  I thought about it for a second.  What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me?  I couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.

I continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn't gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road.  I walked until I saw a park 

I don't know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention.  I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out.  I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache.  Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away.  I don't know when I'll ever be able to capture it again.

Today, I woke back up in purgatory where I'll remain.

6100,"21M, I rang up a suicide line last week. Talked about my situation, was at low point, family problems, loneliness, so like explaining the affects of long term abuse from parents on me now, 3 years later (depression, dissaccociation, paranoia etc) - they asked me if I was suicidal or self harmed, I told them I researched about it and listened to songs related to it, but I told them I wouldn't do either as it's not a good thing to do etc. I also told them I walk 2 hours a day, which I do most days, I felt by saying that they won't take me as serious. I have to do something all the time to get out of my head

The abuse was emotional abuse from when I was a kid up until 17. I felt like I was wasting their time as I said I wouldn't off myself, I don't want to, I just want the pain to end, I tried to explain that but messed it up. 

I'm now getting 6 CBT sessions (over the phone...meh) in a few weeks, I'm glad I got help and that quickly. Of course. I don't know how to feel about it. I feel 6 sessions isn't enough, but I will give it a try.

6104,"I am a complete fucking mess! 
I don’t shower. I don’t brush my teeth. I wear the same cloths for weeks on end. I eat whatever terribly unhealthy food I can get my hands on with the littlest amount of effort (which means a lot of fast food and microwave meals) as much as I can, as often as I can in an attempts to satiate my hungry soul. I sleep every moment that I can and when I am forced to get out of bed to go to work or fulfill another obligation I put on a fake smile and do what ever it is as fast as I can and then rush back to my bed. When I’m awake I wish I was asleep and long for the mind numbing effects of this sweet drug to dampen my incessant thoughts that damn near drive me insane day and night. I spend any free waking moments that I have in a perpetual cycle of combing over self help books and mental health articles and YouTube videos striving with my whole soul to find out what is wrong with me and how to fix it and then somewhere along the lines falling into long bouts of hopeless despair where my only object is to numb my mind with funny YouTube videos or porn. Then I eat more unhealthy food and sleep as much as I can and repeat the cycle in another few days. In a strange way I seem to put vast amounts of effort into being extremely lazy. I fear everything and find happiness in nothing. I neglect to take care of my basic human needs while striving with my whole soul silence the ever looming negative, self loathing thoughts in my head. My whole soul is ready for sweet, blissful death but as yet I haven’t found the wherewithal to finally end it all, telling myself “one more day” or “one more week” and now it has been months and years and still I feel the same. No meds have helped, talking to a counselor has felt like walking in circles and any attempt I have made to better my mental state has led to me feeling all the more lost and weak when my best attempts fall flat.

Everything I do is boring or I don’t care about it or I find it overwhelming. I’m just so bored, I need something to do. But I hate everything, nothing is holding my interest. I’ve bounced around from activity to activity (ones that I usually enjoy doing). This is making everything so much worse than if I could just do something. I have no interest in leaving the house, plus I live in a COVID hot-spot so I can’t leave the house.

All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now.",1,feel numbing person people available cant blame lately complain problems getting worse gotten point cant enjoy life anymore feel like im letting time hate ive witty clever fun im black hole absorbs peoples energy feels like ive lost ability feel true happiness feel like life ended childhood ended childhood failed attempts feeling good lately lie bed stare ceiling night thought comes hits sensitive spot emotional breakdown lose control moment urge physically punish sharp knife blindly cut legs grab bottle trichloroethylene inhale pass nearly killed past emotions pass feeling cycle repeats ive lost interest things liked brings joy anymore times feel good ridiculous caffeine joint feeling passes quickly feeling like shit think suicide couple times day cant kill cause people actually care lose control actions thought im scared actually try ive attempted suicide 7 times late teens heavily struggling drugs luckily succeeded havent proper diagnose symptoms bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder avoidant personality disorder bipolar symptoms present life slowly developed time appointment psychiatrist week doubt talking help thought im hoping medication help feel better probably change things life cant long feel way

6147,"I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to.

I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he’s doing better but I’ve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I’ll do minimal contact once he’s feeling better.. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it’s gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it’s my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It’s hard making friends and I don’t want to bother my friends down here. 

I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It’s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.

I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn’t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I’m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. 

Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they’re english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said “what do you want me to do?! Did y’all call them like i told you?” they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn’t answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn’t answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn’t tell us to call them whenever they aren’t there if we need help if they don’t want to help. So what’s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can’t help them and to please go away.

I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn’t meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I’m tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don’t know when I’ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I’m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don’t want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn’t attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I’m wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I’m overthinking. 

So now I’m thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don’t even know how to have a self care and love day. I’m just too scared to go to work :( I don’t know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely.

6209,"I'm a terrible person and I know it. I'm shitty towards my family, my friends and to myself. I honestly don't want to be alive because I feel like everyone I come in contact with will eventually become miserable like me. I think this started ever since I was a little girl. I've always been a really highly sensitive person and anxious person. Whenever someone treats me badly, I hold an enormous grudge against them. I desperately want them to feel the hurt I went through when they did what they did to me but you see, that always goes really badly. Whenever someone does or says something mean to me, I never tell it straight to their face but rather keep it inside until one day I explode and cry to someone else about it. The person always ends up finding out and honestly each time I feel really shitty about it. For example, recently, I had a group project that really stressed me out because I felt like I was the one putting more effort and time into it, so one day I couldnt take it anymore and I started to break down and I ranted about it to my teacher. I wasn't going to name names but then my teacher asked me about it and I had to answer because one way or another, she would've figured it out. I told her who my groupmates were and today, she scheduled a meeting with one of the groupmates that I pointed out. Also, this groupmate is known for not doing her work and it was true in my group as well, I did assign her work to do but she never done it and always said that she has no time. She only ever helped me out with minor stuff but honestly, I don't think it was enough. Out of all my groupmates, I felt like she was putting in the least effort and because of that I didnt really have anything nice to say about her to my teacher. However, after speaking with my teacher, I learned that she is really trying her best and is struggling with her work too and that made me think that I was being selfish and that I shouldnt have said anything about her at all...but thats too late...now she knows....besides that, she's also really close to my close friend in school but I'm too scared to say anything about her to my friend because I did not want us end up in a huge fight and I was certain that it would. Thus, I always resorted to being fake with her and agreed that she did a lot of work and even gossiped about my other groupmates behind their backs... But, my teacher end up telling her what I said and I think that her and my close friend hates me now...I also ended up worrying and crying about it to my mom and we ended up in a huge fight because she says that I always doing things like this and when it blows up on me I end up breaking down. She also says that I'm in the wrong for ranting to my teacher but I only did that because I know she's tired of listening to me rant and honestly I felt it was true that I felt stressed in that group project. During our fight, my mom and I said really mean things to each other and it really felt like I was stabbed in my back. I genuinely think that I'm a terrible person because of the way I am...and I feel like the world would honestly be a better place without me..",1,im terrible person know im shitty family friends honestly dont want alive feel like come contact eventually miserable like think started little girl ive highly sensitive person anious person treats badly hold enormous grudge desperately want feel hurt went goes badly says mean tell straight face inside day eplode cry person ends finding honestly time feel shitty eample recently group project stressed felt like putting effort time day couldnt anymore started break ranted teacher wasnt going names teacher asked answer way wouldve figured told groupmates today scheduled meeting groupmates pointed groupmate known work true group assign work said time helped minor stuff honestly dont think groupmates felt like putting effort didnt nice teacher speaking teacher learned trying best struggling work think selfish shouldnt said allbut thats latenow knowsbesides shes close close friend school im scared friend want end huge fight certain resorted fake agreed lot work gossiped groupmates backs teacher end telling said think close friend hates nowi ended worrying crying mom ended huge fight says things like blows end breaking says im wrong ranting teacher know shes tired listening rant honestly felt true felt stressed group project fight mom said mean things felt like stabbed genuinely think im terrible person way amand feel like world honestly better place

6213,"Dont think I was meant to be a mom, maybe I'll kill myself insteadSince having my baby in January I've been increasingly depressed, angry, and anxious. I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse.

I thought I would be able to calm myself like I always do after a rough day at work, But today just keep getting angrier as the day goes on. I’m enraged but i don’t know why. I know I’m not going to kill myself. I know i’m not. I feel like a fraud posting here, like. There are other people that need to vent, I don’t even know if i’m going to hit the post button. Other people that need to be talked down from the ledge. I joke a lot about how I might kill myself. Nobody ever takes me seriously. I make sure of that. I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help. I can’t afford professional help though. I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk. Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to. 

My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident. When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing. I don’t want my parents to find me. I really don’t want to die. I don’t. And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid, I thought at least.

6218,"I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughs for about seven years. During my parents divorce and while I was still living with my mom, she would get really angry and one day told me that I was stupid just like my dad that I wouldn't amount to anything and that just kinda stuck with me. She often threatened to put me and my brother in an orphanage and she sometimes punched me cause I hung around my dad's fiance. DHS found out what she was doing so they put me and my brother at my dads house. During that time, I got my first relationship 4 years ago and I felt like it was the first time someone liked me for me and actually wanted to be with me. We were best friends I talked to her about everything  she told me that she would never leave me and that she'd stick with me through the rough parts. Unfortunately I was extremely emotional and over time the relationship became too much for her. Not to say there weren't any good moments cause there was but she broke up with me last year saying that she needed to focus on college and that she wasn't looking to date. She told me I should take this time to get myself together and to be successful. Over the course of that year I won a state championship in football, got a full ride to the school I wanted to go to and am now currently majoring in computer science. First week of college and I felt pretty lonely cause I'm awkard and its extremely difficult for me to make friends so I decided to text her and catch up to see how things were. She told me to never contact her again and that she has a new boyfriend.

Overall I'm alone and just want someone to love me for me. Feel like I lost my best friend and my dad and stepmom support me but I wish it was someone outside of my family, not trying to sound unnappreciative and I'm grateful for that but I don't have anyone to talk to at school and after doing everything that I've done my dad tells me I should be proud of my accomplishments but I feel no better than how I was 7 years ago and still struggling with depression and feel worthless and question whether life is still worth living. Sometimes I don't want to be here anymore so that way I would stop feeling sad or sorry for myself.",1,ive struggled depression suicidal thought seven years parents divorce living mom angry day told stupid like dad wouldnt kinda stuck threatened brother orphanage punched cause hung dads fiance des found brother dads house time got relationship 4 years ago felt like time liked actually wanted best friends talked told leave shed stick rough parts unfortunately etremely emotional time relationship werent good moments cause broke year saying needed focus college wasnt looking date told time successful course year won state championship football got ride school wanted currently majoring computer science week college felt pretty lonely cause im awkard etremely difficult friends decided tet catch things told contact new boyfriend overall im want love feel like lost best friend dad stepmom support wish outside family trying sound unappreciative im grateful dont talk school ive dad tells proud accomplishments feel better 7 years ago struggling depression feel worthless question life worth living dont want anymore way stop feeling sad sorry

6224,"I decided to quit my job today.

My therapist found out that I wanted to stop being a client with her and instead work with someone else.

It seems like I've lost the social support of half my friends due to a work situation that caused me to quit.

Depression, anxiety, and paranoia are pounding away at me. 

I'm scared that people I know are (metaphorically) whispering behind my back about me. And that they are going to do something to me . . . they're conspiring against me.

I want to end things, but I'm too scared to really do anything. It's more of a feeling of not wanting to wake up after I go to sleep.

As the title says, life seems to be in freefall for me. 2021 has been a terrible year for my mental health so far, and I can't see any hope of it getting better. That could be my depression talking, I don't know. Sometimes I just seem to embody my depression or be defined by it.",1,decided quit job today therapist found wanted stop client instead work like ive lost social support half friends work situation caused depression aniety paranoia pounding away im scared people know metaphorically whispering going theyre conspiring want end things im scared feeling wanting wake sleep title says life freefall 2021 terrible year mental health far cant hope getting better depression talking dont know embody depression defined

6232,"I never thought up I'd grow up into such a loserI'm 19, ive had private schooling my whole education. When I started getting into my teens I suddenly got ""secretly sad"". I was really cheerful and funny, kind of like the class clown, but when I got home I used to cut my thighs and cry all night. That faded away when I was in grade 11. Cause I simpler didn't even have time to be sad. My immigrant father was expecting good grades and I had to deliver.  I studied really hard in my last yr to get into uni. Problem is I picked the wrong thing. I picked architecture, I don't even know why I picked it. the only reason is reputation. I wanted my parents to be able to brag. My brother and sister are going to study medicine when they graduate. And me.. I had no idea and when I told my parents that they told me to shutup and get a grip. For fear of disappointment, I picked something that sounded great, and something that I thought would appeal to me,being the creative type. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. The first week I knew this is not what I wanted to do with my life. But I had another class I liked that made me realise I would enjoy a different course. I thought oh hey no biggie, I can just transfer right? ... wrong. I told my parents that I was thinking of transfrrring and they almost fucking killed me. They said I was quitting. That I was lazy. That I was giving up. I said okay fair enough it's only been half a year I'll give it another go. I ended up failing every single one of my classes in my first year. I was so sad I couldn't sleep. I was always afraid to tell my parents about my depression, so I never got help. It was so bad I would get jitters and I would uncontrollably cry. I wanted to cut again but I didn't even have the energy for that. I could t tell them I'd failed because I'd probably be thrown out of the house.  My dad legit said either study architecture or get out of uni. My parents are middle eastern and so they're very strict. Especially my dad. I get that they want the best for me but yeah. It's tough. So at the end of first year I asked if I could transfer again, they said no. I was put on restriction at uni for failing so much. And I could only do it part time. I pretended I was going to uni on days I didn't have it so my parents wouldn't notice.  I failed one class and passed 3, which weren't architecture subjects but were things related to the course I wanted to be in. Now, I'm at the end of my second year in this stupid course. Wasting money each day with something I don't have the talent for. It eats me up inside knowing I have taken someone who is passionate about this fields place. It kills me. I'm so sad I can't even smile anymore. I get yelled at by everyone all the time. My whole family puts me down everyday not only because I don't smile and I'm pretty mean to people now, but also because I'm overweight. Just last week my mother told me I was everything she hates in a person. Sometimes I cry so much my tears don't even come out anymore. I just want to be loved and supported. I have so much pressure on my shoulders and no one understands how bad I want to end it all. I'm a coward. I'm scared of death yet I pray every day for it to come. I feel like I'm dying slowly. I don't know what to do anymore.

6352,"I was in an extremely complicated 6+ year relationship and found out from her about a month ago that she cheated on me. I didn't take a ton of time to process and tried my best to forgive even though there was some resentment after only a few weeks. This cheating episode was likely due to sexual incompatibility so we decided to take a ""non-exclusive break"" so my girlfriend could explore other relationships (same with me) and we could both take time to ourselves. I was interested in working on this relationship and was hesitant about the break but she pushed so much for it that I let it happen. After about a week, thoughts of her feeling the need to go to other people to fulfill sexual desires/physical intimacy go in my head and started to severely affect my self worth. I communicate my feelings and she immediately agrees to work on the relationship and ""focus on us."" 

I thought the situation was looking better and better by the day. However, I noticed a screenshot she sent her friend once that included messages from a guy friend of hers. Something along the lines of ""I wish we could cuddle and watch a movie right now."" I boiled with anger and sadness and am in disbelief she left that detail away from me. This was a friend I always had some worry about and expressed my concern to her several times in the past (she just wrote it off despite him giving weird signals). She later told me he told her he has feelings for her (just a few days ago) and that she has to figure out where she stands in this relationship and in her feelings for him. She said she had to weigh the pros and cons of me and him.

The roller coaster of the past few months has sapped me of all my energy and has drained a ton of my focus throughout the day. My productivity at work is markedly worse because I randomly get fixated on what happened and start feeling either sad or angry. My self worth is completely shot at this point because I feel as though I'm inadequate in the bedroom (the fact she went to someone else). Also, the fact that she has to weigh how she feels about me vs. him (after being in a 6+ year relationship) is CRAZY and makes me feel worthless. I think about killing myself. I think about what the easiest way to kill myself would be (jumping off a bridge, asphyxiation, OD). I think about how it'd be convenient if a truck were to run me over while walking on the street or if I were to find out I have late stage cancer. I have so much hurt and pain that I just want to end. Literally the only thing keeping me from doing this is that I do not want my parents to feel intense sadness, to make them alone, and leave my dog without me. 

I'm not sure what my question is. But if someone has tips for dealing with this stuff, focusing their attention on important real life things while these issues are happening, or ideas for channeling anger/depression, that'd be helpful",1,etremely complicated year relationship found month ago cheated didnt ton time process tried best forgive resentment weeks cheating episode likely seual incompatibility decided noneclusive break girlfriend eplore relationships time interested working relationship hesitant break pushed let happen week thoughts feeling need people fulfill seual desires physical intimacy head started severely affect self worth communicate feelings immediately agrees work relationship focus thought situation looking better better day noticed screenshot sent friend included messages guy friend lines wish cuddle watch movie right boiled anger sadness disbelief left detail away friend worry epressed concern times past wrote despite giving weird signals later told told feelings days ago figure stands relationship feelings said weigh pros cons roller coaster past months sapped energy drained ton focus day productivity work markedly worse randomly fiated happened start feeling sad angry self worth completely shot point feel im inadequate bedroom fact went fact weigh feels year relationship crazy makes feel worthless think killing think easiest way kill jumping bridge asphyiation odd think itd convenient truck run walking street find late stage cancer hurt pain want end literally thing keeping want parents feel intense sadness leave dog im sure question tips dealing stuff focusing attention important real life things issues happening ideas channeling anger depression thatd helpful

6383,"Just a small summary about me....I am someone who loves attention, I've never been lonely, I always have a bunch of people either with me or active with me online. I have the world's biggest guilty conscience so even the smallest lie would kill me coz of guilt. I am also not a sexual person. I overthink a whole lot but since I've always been busy up until quarantine, none of the overthinking thoughts affected me. Overall I'd say I'm an amazing person, that's what I've always thought about myself up until quarantine decided to destroy my mental health and everything is plain fucked up right now....

THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

I made a grave error of letting myself be completely idle this quarantine. The childhood sexual abuse I went through when I was 5 suddenly popped inside my mind and I went into sever depression by obsessively thinking about it( though it's never bothered me till now, I'm 20) . I'd become curious about my own body and accidentally discovered masturbation, which is so out of character for me. It lead to shame more guilt and I've stopped it completely after about 7-8 weeks but I still feel guilty af about it. I've seen my best friends doing all this productive fun stuff with their friends but I don't have any friends in my country now since we've all been out of touch since I left for another country for grade 9-12. I started just screenshot ting stuff from other people's stories or something and posting it on my story to make it.look like I'm eating good food and having a good time like everyone else since I felt plain boring (I did it about 5 times before my guilty conscience shut me down). 

I've been away from the love of my life for 2 years now (we should've met if not for corona). And I cry everyday coz I'm miss him so much. Idk if it's because of my extreme love for him and my extreme loneliness right now that I started having all these terrible intrusive thoughts including other guys and it deeply disturbed me.

6388,"It gets worse beyond death.28 y/o divorced male here. With one beautiful son, and he's god sent. That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.

I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. 

I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. 

Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain,  my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life.

6417,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it.

You can see my previous posts. Before I was suicidal. I self harmed a lot. I was unhappy and didn’t feel secure in the friendships I had. 

Now we are 8months into the year and I’m doing really well. Self harming less, I’ve been productive with my time, I have better relationships with everyone around me, I’m taking my medication properly and I’m back in therapy. I’m not going to pretend it’s been plain sailing. I’ve slipped up a few times. I have days where everything is too much and I can’t concentrate and feel overwhelmed. But those days are few and far between, and they seem more manageable now. I’m finally learning to look after myself and set appropriate boundaries, while also now being able to be there for my friends too because I’m in a better place.

I’ve had issues with my mental health for ten years. It’s difficult. And maybe I started getting better for the wrong reasons. But it’s turned into me realising I’m the only person that’s 100% there for me. Other people encourage and support, and that really helps. But it’s only you that will save you.

She asked and needed help around the house and eventually I became a backup-Foster Parent. Many different children passed through our home, we even adopted one. But I hate how my life has become. I've not had a relationship, hell I'm scared of rejection. I've never had a serious job, I've babysat, done computer and bike repair, taught some people how to do art for money and such but I've never had a part-time or full-time. I've had chances like cleaning cars but she thought that was below me so I never pursued that. Here I am though at a much older age looking at my life and... I have a roof over my head. My finances aren't what they should be but I'm not poor. My health is okay even if I'm slightly overweight but... success. I don't have it. I regret spending so long teaching kids and taking care of them and I feel like my life has withered away. I feel like I should of reached success by now, the thought of redoing school after 9 years sickens me. I know I've grown lazy or complacent. I wonder what would happen if she died... what would happen to me. Someone who's only knowledge is early highschool, teaching myself about computers and having no social or job experience. I never thought I'd grow up to feel like a bum. In school I was somewhat oddly popular. I was the goth kid and the class clown at times but my grades weren't horrible. I was shy I never spoke unless someone spoke to me first but I loved talking to people... I don't know what to do but figured I'd let it all out.   


It's weird out of all this I somewhat got a kid. He turned 15 yesterday, he looks up to me a lot. He is always around me and I've taught him everything I know about life and trying to be an upstanding person in the world. I lied told him I passed college and that he should do the same.

That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.


I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.


“Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”


The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.


“Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”


Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


“How would she react?”


“What would the funeral look like?”


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.

I reacted.....poorly. I said things on Facebook, mentioned her having an abortion, contacted her friends, and generally became pretty creepy about the whole thing. 

      Not a day goes by where I wouldn't give anything just for her to speak to me, even to call me the shithead I am. She wont , not one word in five years, can't blame her.

Now, I am afraid to even find anyone else, I feel tainted and unworthy. 

I have avoided doing well in school or work my entire life, I have a pretty decent IQ but all that does is give me fucked up thoughts of despair and meaninglessness. 

I suck at writing. 

When I'm happy people want to be near me, but I never am. I spend my days smoking pot, caring for my ailing father, mother, and a kid they adopted for whatever reason. I can't even kill myself because if I did she goes to cps and gets placed in foster care. I like her enough and she's a good kid. I just can't do it. I am not up to this task.

My health is failing me in multiple ways. Developed allergies to wheat, tomatoes, fruits, rice, onions.....lots of plants. All I can eat is corn, oats, meat and potatoes, as far as I can tell.

6518,"Everything just feels shit.I'm a 15 year old male who is suicidal. I told my mom and stepdad that I was very depressed and they laughed and said that I wasn't. I've also told my friends and one of them just thought I said it as a joke and my 2 other friends are too depressed to get help from.
I have been depressed since I was 13 but when I turned 15 I got suicidal. I feel lonely and I think about how I should kill myself when I'm at school or when I'm eating etc. 
I almost never sleep for more than 2-4 hours per night which makes me very tired at school and I only sleep in class. 

I don't really have a good reason for being suicidal except that I hate the way everyone lives, wake up, go to work, get paid, go home, eat, sleep and then it starts all over again. I also feel like i'm such a dick towards everyone, as I don't care about anything anymore, some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything. 

Being alive is just pain and suffering. I've almost stopped feeling emotions at all, I don't feel empathy towards people anymore, only for animals. Now at school i've just started pretending that everything is alright after someone said that I was emo or something like that and now it's just too hard to ""be happy"".

But since 6 months ago, when I met my new girlfriend, I feel like I’m too obsessed with her to the point where I started choking or even cutting myself when I felt like she was mad at me.

I have pretty fragile psyche so this shit can really put me on my knees. It happens daily. It got to the point where she almost broke up with me. But I knew that if she would leave me, I would have no other purpose in life. I don’t know if I’m just too optimistic, but the only future I can see is with her. I have no friends, my family treats my like shit but she doesn’t. It’s just my mind putting me in a state where I think she treats me like shit because I deserve it so I deserve to suffer.

I was pretty much used as a slave for getting him off however he required or to tend to his attentive needs, I slept in the same bed with him it was not my own I basically got moved to the spare bedroom this friend would stay in

It affected me almost immediately as my relationships with friends and other family changed immediately, even now my friends can't even hug or touch me without me shaking or curling into a ball and losing my ability to converse or speak with them properly.

And this friend in question would constantly push his feelings onto me I think he loved me in some delusional way especially with how he would touch or talk to me so intimately he must of seen me as more then i should've ever been in the position to be, I can't even run my own hands through my hair or along my body without just feeling my skin crawl all over and I feel so stressed thinking about those situations that I've thrown up during therapy sessions numerous times.

6542,"What was this all for?


Was it punishment for some future sins, I have yet to commit? Or perhaps sins committed so long ago they're written into the pages of history? Or maybe just maybe, there was no reasoning. 
Maybe bad things just happen. Maybe I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe it wasn't a punishment as such,  a learning experience from a young age, created to forge me into the person who I am today. Maybe. Or maybe it was just bad luck.

 Either way, I feel as if though it's important to address these experiences as what they truly are. To strip them back to the bone and stop questioning why. Because sometimes there is no why. There is no how or when. There just is. And nothing can change that. The past after all, is a double ended blade. It can harm and it can heal. You can learn from it and you can lie about it. You can twist it and morph it, blanket it in a shroud of lies. But the truth will always remain whether it is acknowledged or not. The pain will never go away. You can't lie it out of existence. The only way forwards is to accept that it hurts. And maybe some day, the bleeding will stop, and the wound will begin to heal. It won't just go away though. It'll leave a nasty scar, but my dear, those scars will help you remember who you are, and what you've done.


 Whether you've fought against the dark phantoms of the mind, or the monsters hidden behind the facade of a friendly smile and a heart of gold, you are strong. Your scars will remind you of the battles you have fought and the pain you have endured. Wear them with pride. Acknowledge the sorrow they have brought you, and cast it away, like a stone on a pond. And then maybe one day you’ll be able to smile again. Maybe one day everything will feel okay. Things might get better, but then again, they might not. Just remember how strong you are for continuing this fight when you can't even see any light at the end of your long tunnel. It'll never be the same as before, but it would be a bit dull, if everything stayed the same don't you think?


I don't really know if this is the right place to post this. I just felt like it needed to be shared, and this is the only place I post things. I'm sorry if its in the wrong place. Let me know if it is, and I'll change it. 

Thank you for reading. 
I hope you have a fantastic rest of your day.",1,punishment future sins commit sins committed long ago theyre written pages history maybe maybe reasoning maybe bad things happen maybe wrong place wrong time maybe wasnt punishment learning eperience young age created forge person today maybe maybe bad lucky way feel important address eperiences truly strip bone stop questioning change past double ended blade harm heal learn lie twist morph blanket shroud lies truth remain acknowledged pain away cant lie eistence way forwards accept hurts maybe day bleeding stop wound begin heal wont away thought itll leave nasty scare dear scars help remember youve youve fought dark phantoms mind monsters hidden facade friendly smile heart gold strong scars remind battles fought pain endured wear pride acknowledge sorrow brought cast away like stone pond maybe day youll able smile maybe day feel okay things better remember strong continuing fight cant light end long tunnel itll bit dull stayed dont think dont know right place post felt like needed shared place post things im sorry wrong place let know ill change thank reading hope fantastic rest day

6545,"hi guys! i'm sorry if this is all over the place, i kinda just wanted to vent and also get any advice to feel better. just want to put a disclaimer before i start: i realize i am very lucky and have a lot to be grateful for. the things im worried about are nothing compared to other peoples problems, i understand that, but that doesn't just negate my feelings of sadness. just been really thinking about myself and life in general. i apologize in advance.

anyways, i basically graduated a year early from college (i was supposed to graduate this year, but graduated last year in 2020). i was depressed all of last year because i couldn't find a job and it was also peak pandemic so that didn't make anything better. i finally found a job in may and thought i would be happy but i'm not. im upset because your young 20s are supposed to be your prime and right now, its feeling the opposite.

theres nothing wrong with my job, im actually really happy with it. i actually feel guilty because i know how hard it is to find a job nowadays. i think the main reason why im so sad is because i've been feeling kind of lonely. in college, i was constantly with friends, either at each others dorms or going out to parties. now im back home, still living with my parents. i have like 2-3 friends who live near me who i see often but most of my college friends live in the city so its a lot harder to meet up. it makes me feel bad seeing everyone hanging out with their friends when i go on insta or snap. i deactivated both so i don't have to see it so i can just focus on my mental health. i guess also looking at my laptop screen for 8 hours during work then going straight to my phone after work has been making me feel sluggish and depressed. i've been taking 30 min walks around my neighborhood before it gets too cold again without bringing my phone which is helping me feel a lot better. i've also been journaling/manifesting what i want in life (job promotion, meeting new people, making new friends, my own apartment, just being happy). i just really hope a year from now, things are different and im happier.

another part of me also feels bad that i'm single. i know 22 is still really young but i've never been in a relationship before or really done anything with a boy. sometimes, it truly makes me question myself and think theres something wrong with me. i'm very shy when it comes to guys and been trying to push myself to open up but i can't even do that cos im having trouble meeting new people. i've always heard that if you truly just live your life, the relationship thing will come when you least expect it. right now, i don't see that happening anytime soon but im holding onto hope.

im just hoping to meet as many new people as i can and hope the love stuff will happen naturally because i'm not into dating apps. i'm not sure where to meet new people/make new friends. my company is having an happy hour and usually i would be too nervous to go to an event alone where i don't really know anyone because we've all been working remote, but im REALLY trying to force myself out of my shell and meet new people/get new experiences. i really hope it goes well.

yeah, im sorry if this is messy but basically i guess my main goal is to meet new people/make new friends/experience new things as much as possible but i'm not sure how to do that. i've been trying to look on the bright side such as ill be able to save a lot of money, truly ""find myself"", etc. i guess ill just fully focus on myself and my goals. i've been just been putting all my efforts into my work so i can get a promotion and then finally move out. hopefully, when i move out, ill be happier and itll give me back that college environment since im hoping to find roommates to get really close with.

yeah i understand this is your typical 22 year old confused dilemma but its been lowkey messing with my head. if you have any tips on how to meet new people/make new friends/be less shy/how to focus on myself, let me know, thanks.",1,hi guys im sorry place kinda wanted vent advice feel better want disclaimer start realize lucky lot grateful things im worried compared peoples problems understand doesnt negate feelings sadness thinking life general apologize advanced anyways basically graduated year early college supposed graduate years graduated year 2020 depressed year couldnt find job peak pandemic didnt better finally found job thought happy im im upset young supposed prime right feeling opposite theres wrong job im actually happy actually feel guilty know hard find job nowadays think main reason im sad ive feeling kind lonely college constantly friends dorms going parties im home living parents like 23 friends live near college friends live city lot harder meet makes feel bad seeing hanging friends insta snap deactivated dont focus mental health guess looking laptop screen 8 hours work going straight phone work making feel sluggish depressed ive taking 30 min walks neighborhood gets cold bringing phone helping feel lot better ive journaling manifesting want life job promotion meeting new people making new friends apartment happy hope year things different im happier feels bad im single know 22 young ive relationship boy truly makes question think theres wrong im shy comes guys trying push open cant cos im having trouble meeting new people ive heard truly live life relationship thing come epect right dont happening anytime soon im holding hope im hoping meet new people hope love stuff happen naturally im dating apps im sure meet new people new friends company having happy hour usually nervous event dont know weve working remote im trying force shell meet new people new eperiences hope goes yeah im sorry messy basically guess main goal meet new people new friends eperience new things possible im sure ive trying look bright ill able save lot money truly find etc guess ill fully focus goals ive putting efforts work promotion finally hopefully ill happier itll college environment im hoping find roommates close yeah understand typical 22 year old confused dilemma lookey messing head tips meet new people new friends spychow focus let know thanks

6572,"Back here again...I don't know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don't think I need. They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.

The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.

I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.

I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.

It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition. This leaves me with no choice. It's going to end soon.

6579,"So sorry for writing this much. I have anxiety and depression and I've been actively trying to work on my abandonment issues since a really hard breakup last summer, it seems things got a bit better, I made some big (for me) steps by myself, but I don't know how to keep improving. It's easier to get better in the face of adversity, if I didn't push through it then, I don't know how I could've kept going at all, but having things be more comfortable now, I don't know how to keep improving. I started therapy towards the end of last year, but sadly I don't feel comfortable with the only therapist I can afford, so it hasn't been helping. I've been with my new boyfriend for a few months now, and I want to be as healthy as I possibly can be in this relationship, I don't wanna spiral into thinking he's gonna leave me and feel like I can't deal with it all over again if he does. Some nights, something triggers that fear and I start crying and thinking very irrationally, I've been able to get my thoughts together after I cry it out and slowly move on from it the next day, the fact that he's good to me probably helps. These last few days I haven't been feeling too well, being more emotional makes it harder to see things in a more rational way, I had a bad day, and just came down from a panic attack thinking about possibly losing my boyfriend, and I'm tired of feeling that way, I don't wanna hurt like that, I really try my best, but thing is, I don't know what to try, I don't know where to turn. Most times I keep these freak outs to myself and if he asks what's up I just tell him I'm having a hard time with my abandonment issues, cause I don't wanna stress him, and guess what, I'm scared if I disclose too much he's gonna become distant, and you know, leave. I wanna know, if any of you struggle with, and mproved their abandonment issues, what is something that clicked for you, regarding making the thought of being abandoned more bearable? Even something that helped just a little bit? Or your thought process during a turning point? The most random thing, don't be afraid to share. I think that's what can help, make it seem less tragic than it feels, and try to rationalize through that. Obviously I don't expect to become numb, but I hope one day in my life I'll be able to feel closer to what a normal person feels when someone leaves them, and I think not having this constant fear can help the relationship have even more chances of succeeding, which is obviously the preferred outcome.",1,sorry writing aniety depression ive actively trying work abandonment issues hard breakup summer things got bit better big steps dont know improving easier better face adversity didnt push dont know couldve kept going having things comfortable dont know improving started therapy end years sadly dont feel comfortable therapist afford hasnt helping ive new boyfriend months want healthy possibly relationship dont wanna spiral thinking hes gonna leave feel like cant deal nights triggers fear start crying thinking irrationally ive able thoughts cry slowly net day fact hes good probably helps days havent feeling emotional makes harder things rational way bad day came panic attack thinking possibly losing boyfriend im tired feeling way dont wanna hurt like try best thing dont know try dont know turn times freak outs asks whats tell im having hard time abandonment issues cause dont wanna stress guess im scared disclose hes gonna distant know leave wanna know struggle proved abandonment issues clicked making thought abandoned bearable helped little bit thought process turning point random thing dont afraid share think thats help tragic feels try rationalize obviously dont epect numb hope day life ill able feel closer normal person feels leaves think having constant fear help relationship chances succeeding obviously preferred outcome

Finally got to quit being homeless 6 months ago.  Already lost my job and don't know or understand how to handle living real life in a real house.

I have no food, my state won't fund me food stamps, I don't talk to ANYONE outside of the internet, including my roommates, who were at one point great friends of mine and helped me get back on my feet in the first place.

6609,"I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:

As far as I know, my school’s never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn’t be SURPRISED. 
I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn’t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years 😭😭

If I killed myself, all those kids would think “She really did it” and would say “WE drove her to this” and kids at neighbouring schools would say “You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide” and “A girl from (my school) killed herself!” And “Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking “Oh it’s (my name) so it’s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it’s nothing” and now she’s dead.”

Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasn’t there.
I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout “GET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE.” in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 

The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, I’ve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?

I don’t want to stall too much so that I’ve left school when I do it because then the school won’t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn’t because of them. I don’t want the wrong people to be blamed. 

I don’t know how much longer I can go on. It’s like a candle is burning, and I don’t know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn’t much. 

It wouldn’t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.",1,feel like suicide perfectly fitting poetic justice right terms mean far know schools suicide kill biggest effect reasonable people shocked wouldnt surprised severely bullied day 4 years 13 people 6 teachers seen bullying etreme entire year hated knew hated person years maybe school reason control bullying horrible things humanity depressed 2 years friends social life having friends damages self esteem way possible intentionally wrong people bullied burst tears writing didnt deserve single second hell gave day 4 years killed kids think drove kids neighbouring schools know got picked committed suicide girl school killed fun girl reason joke mean bystanders stuck wanted follow crowd thinking oh okay treat like shit look tell kill day like shes dead death raise awareness maybe definitely reduce bullying school pastoral support double maybe purpose care wasnt walk house common room boy announce entrance crowd silenced shout lara wants sincere way pretty clear unwanted cares maybe care way people care dead similarly ive thinking way feel bad stop feeling forever dont want stall ive left school school wont responsibility able wasnt dont want wrong people blamed dont know longer like candle burning dont know left height tell puddle wa isnt wouldnt loss died actually people favour

I feel like a fucking brain dead vegetable when it comes to capability. I’m 23 years old and I have the independence and capability of a 10 year old. Can having aspergers make you weak? I missed out on a lot of life experience because of aspergers. Is there a way to un-shelter myself to become stronger? 

I’m already 23 and I feel like I missed out on so many social and developmental milestones. I feel less valid as a person because a part of me I can’t control has forced me to be this way. Naive, inexperienced, isolated, timid, insecure, out of the loop. Unfashionable because my sensory issues force me to dress like a fucking boring ass person with no aesthetic taste (In fact I have very strong aesthetic taste but I can’t express it through fashion like I want to.) This isn’t who I truly am. This is the persona I have unintentionally become as a result of living in this world. I feel utterly trapped in this body and this mind. I want to get out. When I look in the mirror I don’t see myself. I see this haggard miserable grown woman who I never wanted to be. The real me is fun and free and unbothered and sexually liberated and does whatever the fuck she wants and knows how to get what she wants. 

I can’t wait till I can abandon this world and become who I truly am in the afterlife. The thought of that is the only thing that keeps me going. I feel like all I can manage to do is try to cope and minimize my pain for the remainder of this life. I’d end it right now if I wasn’t so afraid of pain.

6622,"It feels so much like I'm just attention-seeking. 

My depression went untreated for almost 4 years, because... Why would I be depressed? There was nothing wrong with my life. I was going to middle school, learning pretty well, having a lot of friends. Needless to say it's all gone now.

I'm now almost 20 and I've been depressed for 6 years. These years have ruined me. I'm a different person now. I'm supposed to be an adult, but I barely take care of myself. I have no friends. Routines, like university or jobs, scare me senseless. I feel I will never be normal again. 

And all of this... For no reason. 

Just, at some point, at 14 years of age, I became broken. I was tired every day. I didn't feel good anymore. And so many people told me it's not real depression. That I'm just growing up. That it's just my personality, because I was always so whiny. That it's impossible to get help. That someone's sister went to a psychiatrist and they denied her medication. That I will never get better. Because... There is nothing to fix. I'm normal. Nothing happened to me. During the worst time of my life, when I was self harming and planning suicide, nobody noticed me. Because why would they? I had good grades, I was just weird for crying every day during classes. 

There are people who are homeless. Who got their lives ruined. Who got kicked out of their family. Who had their significant other die. Who got their hearts broken. Who watched their children perish to cancer. Who miscarried. Who got assaulted. Who got scammed out of everything. Who are jobless, almost to get evicted and who don't have family to fall back on. Who are complitely alone. There are so many people in such deep pain. 

And I dare to be depressed? It feels like I'm just pretending. 

My mother had depression for a period of time, because her husband divorced her and lied about her to everyone so she almost lost all of her support, and she was about to have her children taken away. My father had depression for a period of time, because he had to see horrors on the job, had to look at broken homes, murdered people and still be efficient. My brother had depression for a period of time, because his parents were getting divorced, and he was lied to so much that he hated his own mother, he was then faced with his father mistresting him and then was bullied for years.

And I'm just... Depressed. For years. For no reason. How dare I?",1,feels like im attentionseeking depression went untreated 4 years depressed wrong life going middle school learning pretty having lot friends needless gone im 20 ive depressed 6 years years ruined im different person im supposed adult barely care friends routines like university jobs scare senseless feel normal reason point 14 years age broken tired day didnt feel good anymore people told real depression im growing personality whiny impossible help someones sister went psychiatrist denied medication better fi im normal happened worst time life self harming planning suicide noticed good grades weird crying day classes people homeless got lives ruined got kicked family significant die got hearts broken watched children perish cancer miscarried got assaulted got scammed jobless evicted dont family fall completely people deep pain dare depressed feels like im pretending mother depression period time husband divorced lied lost support children taken away father depression period time horrors job look broken homes murdered people efficient brother depression period time parents getting divorced lied hated mother faced father mistreating bullied years im depressed years reason dare

I get the feeling, everyday, that the good days are gone, and nothing will feel remotely as happy as it did when I was younger. I have gained so much weight. It has been so long since I had a gf. I might need hip surgery and my left knee hurts aswell, so maybe I won't be able to play soccer with my friends ever again. I am still a few years away from getting my university degree, which should've been done by now.

I get that I'm still young, but I can't shake off this feeling of impending doom.  Seems to me, the only way to feel something good this days is by eating eating junk food, smoking weed or drinking beer. I try as hard as I can to live a healthy life, doing excercise and not depend on drugs to feel normal. But lately, maybe I just don't care anymore. The world is f\*cking ending, and no one seems to care about it. It's not just the pandemic, it's drought, climate change, and who knows what else. And it's all just starting. On top of that, we live in this sick late-capitalist society, where everybody works their ass off to live an unhappy life (except for billionaires, of course).

I projected my anger on my older sister who now probably is reminded why she hates herself. After I ruined her day, I went upstairs and wanted to cut myself but I restrained it. And so, it’s why I don’t mind her telling me that I should kill myself. Because honestly, I should.

So like why the fuck am I not doing it yet? I’m really worthless. Anyone online or physically or whatever could tell me I’m not but that will never get in my head because I know that I’m not. And I’m so stubborn. Unless you hit me with a rock, maybe I’ll listen then. 

Nothing works anymore. Why can’t I just accept the fact that maybe I even have tiny bit of worth? Why can’t I not? 

Maybe it’s just that I’m that much of a sucky person that I failed myself. I think everyone tried too hard to make me kind but I ended up turning out to be the person who I hate most.

I tell myself that half of why I’m like this is because of my dad. But it’s not, isn’t it? Yes, he kept saying I wasn’t a good person. Yes, he hit me whenever I didn’t listen. Yes, he cursed at me and called me stupid over and over again. But that was years ago, I’m a teen now. I’m not supposed to use that excuse anymore, right?

6711,"I have GOT to stop this damn rollercoaster, one way or another. Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I'll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.

I have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.

Some backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard 'precious' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I'm sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I'm starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of 'coincidence'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads ""I need a Job and clothes"". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, ""Hey, yea buddy I need those too..."" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: ""You don't need it"". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the 'synchronicity'.

These things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.

I am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.

Much love for you all, I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction.

6795,"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, never have to feel a thing again. I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression, free from the cage of anxiety and panic.

6840,"Hi,

I've been a bit lost in life I admit since graduating college almost 5 years ago, but a few years ago I realized what used to be fun no longer is. I used to play video games with my friends and still do but feel no joy, I only do it to be able to speak with them. I started baking but I realize I do it to get my mind off things it's not fun it's an accomplishment possibly. 

I started Therapy January 2020 and brought this up with my Therapist that I can't find anything that is fun a few months ago but they didn't say much to my statements and we moved on. I do have anxiety however, right now it's actually much lower than it's ever been. Before they left for vacation almost a month ago they said I have the positive and negative of too much time as I work part time. 

I'm really lost in life right now and was working with a Career Coach and one of the final questions was again something similar if money, expenses didn't matter what would I do for fun. I sat for hours until 2 am thinking and couldn't come up with anything.

The world in general I realize I feel a bit lost, each suburb seems the same and the city raises my anxiety. I don't know where I belong or what to do. There's just wondering what to do and no time for fun or I can't figure out what is/ would be fun. Long walks are relaxing but not fun.

Is this maybe just a phase while I try to get a sense of direction in life? Then things will start showing up that seem fun?

6841,"I don't even know where to begin. I've been severely struggling with depression on top of my anxiety all summer due to my body building up a tolerance to Lexapro and Klonopin. I'm back on Xanax and recently switched to Celexa (sp? Citalopram) after discovering that a higher dose of Lexapro helped minimally, but didn't do the full job. It's been a struggle to function beyond the bare minimum, and I've got a lot of responsibilities in my life related to my career that I can't currently abandon due to financial and insurance needs.

I'm passively suicidal, and I dislike the intrusive thoughts, the paranoia and anxiety that follows me everywhere, and the anhedonia and avolition. It's becoming harder to go on, and it's affecting my work life, my social life, and my family life.

About the only things keeping me afloat are my husband, our cats, planning the cross-country move my husband and I are trying to make next year, very specific music, and the movie Wristcutters: A Love Story. Pretty much nothing else gives me any semblance of joy. I've even stopped finding joy in reading, and that's my ADHD fixation for just about every situation that brings me stress.

I want to feel something besides despair and crushing sadness again. I want to have intrinsic motivation instead of having to drag myself through the motions once more. I want to feel like something more than a semblance of a shell of myself.

But when I met her, I threw the plan away, blew threw my savings and start evolving my life around her. Now that we aren’t together the past couples months I just feel so lost. I tried so many things. I moved back to my home state out of my parents home because I was just so depressed knowing I was near my ex. And I was doing fine I felt good knowing I was away from her and the toxic environment. But I just kept telling myself “what now” and I never had an answer and it would leave me into a deep depression. I lived here for 6 months and I felt like I was accomplishing anything. So I recently moved back to my home town. Where I have actual friends. And it’s going fine but now I’m starting to ask myself again “so what now” and I’m slowly going back into the state of depression. It gets so bad that I start to question my self worth and is it even worth living. And whenever I get depressed I just think of my ex. Sometimes I get so angry and blame her for everything. But then I get sometimes get really sad and end up missing her. I know it’s not her fault at all and I know thinking about her is not healthy at all. Which is why I’m starting to be more social and outgoing. But when I get those moment where I’m alone in bed at night I just go crazy and my mind is everywhere. I just hope I can figure myself out.

6854,"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

6948,"Last night was a big revelation So I used to really like this girl,let’s call her Sophie, and last night I think I never stopped liking her (it’s been like 3 years), I just stopped trying and it happened because I was at a party for my band section and she was there and we were talking just about anything and everything and I just kept getting lost in her eyes and just her being there.

But for the past few months I’ve been liking this other girl, we’ll call her Em, and I’ve been slowly losing feelings and realizing that she’s not worth it. 

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think I’m gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason I’ve been losing feelings for Em is that she’s just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know she’s okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort I’ve been giving.

6986,"My chronic depression is getting worse... This world feels like a nightmare. [NSFL]I'm thinking about suicide a lot...

I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. 

They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know! And that hurts even more. 

If only I could go somewhere else.

But the thing is one of them is a Beagle / old english bulldog mix (his grandpa was one) and the other is a shih tzu bichon Malteser mix. Very different breeds and characters and the beagle mix is already big. 

My brother doesn't really do anything to help, mom can't sleep, dad doesn't really scold the bigger puppy when he gets too roudy with the very small one, I haven't been eating for the last 3 days, my parents are fighting over everything and I have a driving test tomorrow. The second one bc I fucked the first one by driving over a red light.
Can't really talk about this to my friend bc he's pissed that I probably won't go to the cinema with him.

7005,"Hi, I've never posted before so I apologize for any typos or unclear information. For some background, I (24f) have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 9, which was when both my parents were imprisoned. I've been in therapy often, but mostly through college and graduate school. I tried taking an SSRI my first year of graduate school but gave up since it made me more depressed and anxious (I think I may have been too hasty but I was not thinking clearly at the time, and I needed to pass my classes).

Lately I have been feeling myself slip back into this depressive ""cloud"" and I can't for the life of me find any motivation or drive to do what I need to do to go back to my confident, content self. It interferes with my research constantly, and often puts a strain in my relationship. I'm in therapy again but it doesn't feel like it's helping much. I feel like two completely different people constantly battling for control in my head.

Here's why I am hesitant to try another SSRI: After my parent's arrest my brother and I were sent to live with my grandparents, and growing up I watched my grandmother take an SSRI for depression and anxiety but never work towards dealing with the actual root of the problem. She is still taking them to this day but has never really improved since she's just masking some of her symptoms. I don't want to start taking medication and then think I'm fine and stop working towards bettering myself. I'm mainly concerned with this because I tend to ignore my symptoms anyways, so I'm worried I would continue that trend even on meds. Also it takes a lot of time before it's apparent if an SSRI is working, and the weeks after starting or stopping one can be very emotionally draining. I don't feel like I have time to spend searching for the right medication while also maintaining my graduate research.

Has anyone else been through something similar? I guess I'm wondering if it is worth all the trouble to find the right medication and if others have found it difficult to stop even with therapy.",1,ive posted apologize typos unclear information background 24f struggled depression aniety parents imprisoned ive therapy college graduate school tried taking sari year graduate school gave depressed anious think hasty thinking clearly time needed pass classes lately feeling slip depressive cloud cant life find motivation drive need confident content self interferes research constantly puts strain relationship im therapy doesnt feel like helping feel like completely different people constantly battling control head heres hesitant try strip parents arrest brother sent live grandparents growing watched grandmother sari depression aniety work dealing actual root problem taking day improved shes masking symptoms dont want start taking medication think im fine stop working bettering im mainly concerned tend ignore symptoms anyways im worried continue trend meds takes lot time apparent sari working weeks starting stopping emotionally draining dont feel like time spend searching right medication maintaining graduate research similar guess im wondering worth trouble find right medication found difficult stop therapy

7014,"Hello Everyone,

First time poster here - Long time lurker (You know how it is I'm sure)

It's finally time for me to come out of the background and make my first post - and it's in the name of Mental Health Awareness - and Raising Money to Donate towards supports for those struggling with mental health.

A little about me (30M) - I am a Nurse, have been for over 8 years now. A few of those years were in hospitals, a few working with pediatrics in the community and in schools, a few working in a facility designed for mental health rehabilitation and recovery, and a few years with the developmental disabilties sector. While doing all that, I also got a degree in Information Technology and started my IT/Nursing Hybrid Career. Wierd combo I am told - but those are the two things that I love to do.

Anyways - One common thing I saw that was a common theme in all of the workplace settings, and even amongst my friends, and social groups - \* Everyone struggles with mental health at some point in their life \*

Even if its a little depression here, or a little anxiety there - many of us don't even realize. Of course some can cope better than others, and it doesn't always show as prevalent in us all. But trust me when I say that everyone struggles.

I will tell you when I worked on a unit for those suffering from PTSD - I remember sitting and listening to some of the horiffic stories that these individuals told, and had to have experience in their lives, and I just remember thinking that I was no different from any one of these people. If I had gone through what they had, or felt the pain that they had, I would be in the same boat. What I learned was that no one is immune from the toll that this world places on our mental health.

I myself had been hospitalized for some severe depression and addiction in the past. It's fun for no one.

So I come to you today Reddit to Help me Help those that are struggling - as this cause means so much to me. I have designed this Shirt with this cause in mind **ALL PROCEEDS WILL BE DONATED**. Check it out at this link --> [https://danteswaresnstoof.creator-spring.com/listing/don-t-bottle-it-up-mental-he?product=2](https://danteswaresnstoof.creator-spring.com/listing/don-t-bottle-it-up-mental-he?product=2)

In the end all we have is each other - And we can make a difference.",1,hello time poster long time lurker know im sure finally time come background post mental health awareness raising money donate supports struggling mental health little 30m nurse 8 years years hospitals working pediatrics community schools working facility designed mental health rehabilitation recovery years developmental disabilities sector got degree information technology started nursing hybrid career wierd combo told things love anyways common thing saw common theme workplace settings friends social groups struggles mental health point life little depression little aniety dont realize course cope better doesnt prevalent trust struggles tell worked unit suffering remember sitting listening horrific stories individuals told eperience lives remember thinking different people gone felt pain boat learned immune toll world places mental health hospitalized severe depression addiction past fun come today reddit help help struggling cause means designed shirt cause mind proceeds donated check link https danteswaresnstoofcreatorspringcom listing dontbottleitupmentalheproduct2 https danteswaresnstoofcreatorspringcom listing dontbottleitupmentalheproduct2 end difference

7019,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

7034,"Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a ""wall of text"" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, ""just fucking do it."" But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.
see: crappy and depressing pop song about lost love - Katy Perry

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, ""What's wrong with her?"" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

""Why don't you help me cook?"" ""Why don't you initiate sex?"" ""Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?"" ""Why don't you know how to do _____?"" ""Why won't you try this food?"" ""Why can't you make a decision?""
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... ""Why are you all quiet and depressed now?""

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a ""screamer"" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, ""What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!"" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.

I just don't know anymore. I've been fighting this battle for 20 something years now and sometimes I don't know why. I was a pretty happy kid but somewhere in my 20s things changed. As I once described it to my wife, it was a dark cloud that would sit over me for days and days. I wouldn't go anywhere or talk to anyone, just slept and operated like some kind of zombie. Once I met my wife 2006, it all faded away and I was astonished. Was it that easy? 2011 was a bad year, she cheated on me. I lost weight, couldn't sleep, worried and cried all the time. We separated and it was during this time that I realized I needed to see a therapist. She suggested more sessions but I only wanted something so I could go to sleep. Depression runs in the fam so there was no doubt that I had went undiagnosed but I didn't want to be on pills. We reconciled and things were good for a while but slowly the cloud came back and it was difficult to put up a front for them. Now that we have 2 girls, I cannot bear the thought of hurting them but how does one continue on feeling this way? I don't wanna drink or do drugs to numb the pain, and I don't want to take meds because I don't want to be labeled in any way. It's not my fault that I feel like this. Does anyone else feel the same way?

I've done some pretty not cool stuff in my time on earth. But none of it is bad enough to the point where I feel this horrible.

The amount of times I've had people tell me I am the problem, or that I'm toxic, or that I'm crazy is so unfathomable, sometimes I start to think maybe it is true. I don't respond to texts, I'm nosy, I give half-assed advice, and I can't give my love to anybody without giving them too much of me. Recently, well not even recently, since I can remember... I've always felt like a failure. I do everything right, but my family has criticism. I do something wrong and suddenly everybody in the entire world will gang up on me and deflate my sense of self worth. My self esteem is so low I feel like I am barely a person. Just a husk of what once was floating around this world with no purpose. Maybe it would be easier just being that husk and having no responsibilities. Life is the the worst gift any human can be given. I am a disappointment to my dad, my employer, and my teachers. I don't have a work-ethic, I'm shit in school, and I have no energy for small talk. I don't want special treatment yet I wish people could stop looking at me as if I just don't care about life. I do! My brain will not let me be the way other ""normal"" people are. People will mistake my depression for weakness. Which to be fair it is a weakness but not in the sense I mean. In every argument I have, I don't fight back. I comply and move along. So many people take advantage of this and use it to punish me for things I've said in the past or use it to call me toxic because I didn't check up on them when ""they needed it"". How about when I needed it? I don't understand that why out of everybody that I know, I have to be the punching bag. I have to be the one to put the blame on. It is so tiring and exhausting being the only person recognized by my peer who has flaws. 

I thought maybe I could find god and get some sight through this lull. That didn't work either. I thought maybe if I started therapy that would help. it didn't. Maybe eating 3 meals a day would give my face a glow. My skin is still hollow and dull. Maybe falling in love would bring back the glimmer in my eyes. I drove them away. I thought maybe, just maybe, if I moved out and tried to figure out who I am without my family and friends I could rediscover my inner child or whatever those meditation apps try to sell. now I just feel guilty for leaving everybody behind and burning all my bridges.

I know I'm not the only person out there who feels like this. But nobody I knows personally understands how difficult it is to get through each day. 

thanks for reading this.

much love,

7092,"Hello,

I'm not sure where to begin but I figured this would be an ok place. I have been dealing with quite a bit and you are welcome to read my previous comment I made in another thread that goes into detail.

While I am figuring things out, I'd like to ask how you all cope with depression as I lose motivation EA h day that passes. I dread waking up, the drive to work, talking to people. My energy and will to do things are nonexistent as I don't even enjoy doing what I like doing. My free time is spent playing games and reading as that is how I like to unwind but I have not been in the mood to do either of those things.

I would like to make it clear that I do NOT* have any intentions of hurting myself and I am still coming to terms with depression and PTSD. I force myself to manage the day but it is extremely tiring to the point where I don't do much on my time off. The most I do is laundry to make sure I have clothes for the week. I have been eating once a day which I understand is not healthy but I have no appetite and do not want to force something I may not hold down.

It seems I am doing the minimum to keep doing and realize that I cannot do that for long or it may get worse. I am stressed, depressed, anxious and reaching out for help while I am still somewhat rational as it is hard. 

I take B12 as I have a vitamin deficiency though it doesn't seem like it helps. I do also take some heart medicine as the VA still hasn't figured out those issues. While I am not in a relationship, I am seeing someone though I am not sure how long that will last either as my sexual drive has been nonsexist for a while as I know stress and anxiety can effect it. I have been talking to my doctor and it seems I am showing signs of ED though so there is more to add to my plate.

Regardless of it all, I am reaching out to get your input to better myself and thank you for any information.

Thank you.",1,hello im sure begin figured ok place dealing bit welcome read previous comment thread goes details figuring things id like ask cope depression lose motivation ea day passes dread waking drive work talking people energy things noneistent dont enjoy like free time spent playing games reading like unwind mood things like clear intentions hurting coming terms depression ptsd force manage day etremely tiring point dont time laundry sure clothes week eating day understand healthy appetite want force hold minimum realize long worse stressed depressed anious reaching help somewhat rational hard vitamin deficiency doesnt like helps heart medicine va hasnt figured issues relationship seeing sure long seual drive nonseist know stress aniety effect talking doctor showing signs ed add plate regardless reaching input better thank information edit fied typo thank

I’m only 27 and I married the wrong man.  I don’t love him.  We are not compatible.  I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back.  I cut off all ties but he found me anyway.  I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now were married.  I refuse to procreate with him.  I’m not dragging other human life into my misery.  He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.

His debt is following me.  They found my number.  Collectors call every day.  I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector.  My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call.  He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now.  I don’t answer my phone at all anymore.  He owes tens of thousands for student loans and he is pretending like they don’t exist.  He gets angry at me when I try to help.  I’ve given up on the subject.  It will be the ignored weight on our shoulders until the day I die.

My dog has fallen ill.  I have drained my account trying to save him, but now I am out of hope.  It breaks my heart seeing him lay on the floor not moving or eating anymore.  He is going to the vet one more time tomorrow.  Then I am taking him back to the shelter for good.

7169,"I've been struggling with these feelings for a very long time, but after a very recent meltdown and noticeable changes in my own mental state, I think I need some help figuring my own head out. Unfortunately the only way I can adequately explain or vent out my problems is to tell a lot of my life story, so I'm sorry in advance for how long this will be, especially to those dedicated enough to actually read it all. But here goes.   


I'm 25. I turn 26 next month. I'm autistic, specifically I have Asperger's Syndrome. Growing up, there were several things I had a hard time with. Recognizing social cues was a major factor, but more than that I had issues with hallucinations and controlling my emotions. As far as I know every child has issues controlling their anger and other such emotions, but I had a lot of issues with it - that'll be touched on later, though. Because I had hallucinations on a constant basis, I often poked people to make sure they were real. Unfortunately a lot of people didn't like being touched, and the teacher's weren't able to explain it to the students, so naturally it became difficult for me to make friends between the poking and the social difficulties of growing up autistic. I hurt a lot of kids in fifth grade in particular, though I've always assumed that had to do with home troubles - one of my sisters had moved in with us for one, and that came with a lot of stress since she was schizophrenic and manipulative, but more than that, my brother, in middle school at the time, was coming into sexuality and decided because he hated me so much (with good reason - I was shitty to him) that he would use me to 'practice' for when he started actually getting female attention. So between my brother raping me before I knew what rape even was and the stress of the new sibling in the house, it was a bad time all around - although my teacher the previous year hadn't helped any. A tale for another time - suffice to say she hated me because she'd had my brother years before, and my brother was a troublemaker because his own home life was shit no thanks to me.   


But more than the home troubles or the rape, my existence, my personality, my whole sense of worth has been measured in the vast quantity of fuck-ups that have persisted throughout my life. You would think that 26 years into life I'd start learning from my mistakes, but here we are. As a child, I was never really able to learn anything for the sake of normal living other than through osmosis because any attempt to gain said experience often ended in fucking it up. I wasn't allowed to cook until I was in middle school, and only because I had a home ec class. I was seldom asked to clean anything up, because I often used the wrong chemical due to poor parental supervision. The only things I was allowed to do for chores that I couldn't screw up were taking out the trash and walking the dogs. It was certainly enjoyable having nothing to do all day, but honestly, I suffer much now because of it - the only food I can make is eggs or mac and cheese. In more recent times, I've had a lot of issues with my girlfriend who recently underwent major spinal surgery and has been bedridden for a month or so. Any time I try to do something for her without active prompting from someone, it seems to either get in the way or end up fucking something else up. It's gotten to the point where I can't bring myself to do anything without being told to because I'm just getting in the way. It hasn't helped any that home life is incredibly stressful for many reasons that I don't have it in me to explain right now (this post has already taken a lot of energy and I feel like I'm not saying enough of the right things for context) but suffice to say a lot has been making it difficult for me to keep my own emotions in check. More than anything, I need advice.  I'm so tired of being angry all the time, ready to bite anyone's head off for even the slightest of corrections. I don't feel like I can actually do anything I enjoy to take my mind off of things - I can't go for walks, since she needs constant care. I can't play most of my video games for a number of reasons relating to her. I just... I need some way to get this under control. To ease my stress, to lower my anger, to feel like I'm not just... some fuck-up who nobody should have to be burdened with. I want to feel like I offer as much happiness as I imagine she gives me, but I just feel... nothing all the time. I wish I could know what it was like to feel something again, anything other than anger or self-loathing.

She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either.

As much as I enjoyed working from home and not having to commute, I realized I have no freedom to go wherever I want and ""live"" my life, especially now that we're on lockdown once again.

I want to learn a new hobby but guess what, I can't do it at home. I want to just go grab a cup of coffee in peace but the fear of being positive makes me anxious.

6 months ago, my grandma's sister died of covid, and just 2 nights ago, my cousin's grandpa also died due to covid with my cousins, aunt, uncle and their grandma positive with covid. My mom also has to isolate at home because she was in direct contact with her coworker who was positive with covid.

I'm not feeling well myself but it's mostly because of overwork and it irks me thinking that my grandma here at home (not the same grandma who is positive with covid) kept visiting my mom in her room. Yeah, she got vaccinated but I haven't had my full vaccination yet and my younger sister is not yet vaccinated and I kept thinking how irresponsible it is on her part.

Then, I began thinking how I don't have anything to live for and if I do die anytime this year, I  might cry on my deathbed but then again, I'd be reminded how useless my life is and I think I'll die in peace.

7263,"Week 1 of grad school and I'm already a failureI started grad school last week. I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.

I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.

With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever. I'm never going to get my PsyD because I'm a fucking moron who can't manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this. Its almost 5am and I've been trying to calm myself down for the past 2 hours; I finally found this place to vent to. I hope that's okay. My cat is with me so I'm not going to hurt myself.

7265,"I (30/F) could really use some kind words right now. Something, anything, to change the way I’m feeling.

I’ve just ended my second marriage (after breaking up for a year and trying again). This marriage, as well as my first, was toxic and abusive. Mostly emotionally, but physically in both.

I know that leaving was the right decision. But, my worst fear in life is being realized- ending up alone. I don’t mean in the sense of being single; although, as terrible as he was at times, it’s just nice to have someone familiar to come home to, to talk to, to sleep next to. Something that, when things were good, felt like home. Now, I come home and the house is empty and quiet. Full of dead memories and haunting silence.

I don’t want to date again, because I’m afraid of ending up with another toxic man. The only living members of my family are my mom and brother, whom I rarely speak to, and they live in another state.

I don’t really have friends, because it was always so difficult to make them or keep them due to his jealousy and control. As of right now, my depression is active and so is my anxiety because this is a very traumatic situation for me to be in. So, I don’t see myself getting out much to feel less alone. Home doesn’t feel like home, I feel like I was dropped off somewhere and abandoned. 

The world is a scary place right now, I don’t feel safe going out alone or meeting people online, so I don’t know what to do. 

I’m to the point where I’m not thinking about doing anything stupid, but that I am not sure I want to live the rest of my life like this- alone and unable to do anything about it.

I don’t know what I expect anyone to say, I guess I’m just hoping someone can relate and tell me things are going to be ok, or how they adjusted to this.",1,30 f use kind words right change way im feeling ive ended second marriage breaking year trying marriage toic abusive emotionally physically know leaving right decision worst fear life realized ending dont mean sense single terrible times nice familiar come home talk sleep net things good felt like home come home house quiet dead memories haunting silence dont want date im afraid ending toic man living members family mom brother rarely speak live state dont friends difficult jealousy control right depression active aniety traumatic situation dont getting feel home doesnt feel like home feel like dropped abandoned world scary place right dont feel safe going meeting people online dont know im point im thinking stupid sure want live rest life like unable dont know epect guess im hoping relate tell things going ok adjusted

7281,"I thought I was ready to kill myselfI had a hot bath, I cut my left wrist and was planning to just bleed out, i thought it was pretty aesthetic how the water started to look, and how the blood was flowing from my wrists. I started to feel scared, very scared. I'm an atheist, and I accept that there is nothing after we die, but coming so close to it made me scared. Or maybe I'm just a pussy, or going out hannah baker style isn't how I want to go.

I think i'll make a bucket list before I die. There's a few things I want to do before I die. I've never eaten a steak before, I think I'll try that. I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it. I think I'll revisit some old memories from when I was a kid, the area isn't far from me. 

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget. 

My wrists really hurt, i'm in no danger of dying anymore, I'm just dizzy and want water. Maybe I don't even want to die, if i truly dead I wouldn't be alive right now. Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive that's restricting me?",1,thought ready kill hot bath cut left wrist planning bleed thought pretty aesthetic water started look blood flowing wrists started feel scared scared im atheist accept die coming close scared maybe im pussy going hannah baker style isnt want got think ill bucket list die theres things want die ive eaten steak think ill try check thing bucket list today think think ill revisit old memories kids area isnt far im good looking funny confident great hair great voice women money im happy entire personality feels emulate character ive seen suits situation dont feel like person im trying emulate angry edgy unfunny blunt stubborn refusal change grew ultimately suffering suffering fault realised attitudes women outlook life stems deep hatred mother growing wanted die suffer wish talked earlier maybe able functional suppose feeling betrayal person loved leave hurt cant forget wrists hurt im danger dying anymore im dizzy want water maybe dont want die truly dead wouldnt alive right natural instinct survive thats restricting

7363,"I’m 20 and it’s been over two years since I graduated high school but I still wish I was in high school every day. Every goal and purpose I’ve ever had has been classmate-oriented, specifically the classmates I’d known for 12+ years and have grown to truly love and appreciate. Then boom, graduation, and they’re gone. College took up all their time they’d previously had to talk with me and be friends with me. I knew I wasn’t ready for college so I took a gap year then COVID turned it into two gap years. I’ve job hopped a bit and never made close connections with coworkers, so I feel like I’ve lost all of my friends. I’m trying to think of where everything went wrong and I think it’s because at the beginning of the last year of high school I was like “I barely have any friends, imma go make some before graduation!” By doing that I gave myself something about high school to latch onto mentally for a long time. I wish I could undo that because 1) the friends I already had were amazing genuine friends, and 2) while high school had been uneventful up until that point, it was not at all bad. If senior year had too been uneventful, I could move on more easily. But now I just feel like I’m falling.

7387,"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

7405,At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight.

7416,"Years ago I saw this bill burr quote in an Instagram post and I screenshotted it and look back at it frequently. He said “Realize that sleeping on a futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. You know what's worse, sleeping in a king bed next to a wife you're not really in love with but for some reason you married, and you got a couple kids, and you got a job you hate. You'll be laying there fantasizing about sleeping on a futon. There's no risk when you go after a dream. There's a tremendous amount to risk to playing it safe.” 

Now I don’t know if I necessarily played it safe in life. I don’t even know what the risk would have been even if I had taken one. I don’t have a specific burning regret that I wish I would have done. I just wish my life was different. I constantly feel like my life has no purpose, no passion. I feel stuck all the time. I feel stuck in my job, I feel stuck in my relationship, I feel stuck in my city. Part of me wants to marry my partner and have kids, part of me wants to get in my car and drive far away without even telling him why. I’m successful in my career and have established a comfortable life. I have friends who love me. I could make a long list of the things I am grateful for. But still my life feels full of nothingness. And the nothingness is suffocating me. 

A couple months ago on a Sunday I spent the whole day crying because the thought of starting another week of my miserable life was unbearable. I outlined three options for myself. Option #1 Run away. But my anxiety wouldn’t allow this. Where would I go? what would I do? What would become if the life I leave behind? Option #2 Kill yourself. But my conscience wouldn’t allow that. I couldn’t put that pain on everyone else. Option #3 Go to a hospital to get help to figure these dark feelings out. But my ego wouldn’t allow that. I couldn’t stand the thought of explaining that to people, admitting things to people that I can hardly admit to myself. So instead I just went to bed and the next day I started the next week in my miserable life. And I’m still going that. And I still haven’t figured out how to escape the nothingness. I’m still suffocating.",1,years ago saw bill burr quote instagram post screenshotted look frequently said realize sleeping futon youre 30 worst thing know whats worse sleeping king bed net wife youre love reason married got couple kids got job hate youll laying fantasizing sleeping futon theres risk dream theres tremendous risk playing safe dont know necessarily played safe life dont know risk taken dont specific burning regret wish wish life different constantly feel like life purpose passion feel stuck time feel stuck job feel stuck relationship feel stuck city wants marry partner kids wants car drive far away telling im successful career established comfortable life friends love long list things grateful life feels nothingness nothingness suffocating couple months ago sunday spent day crying thought starting week miserable life unbearable outlined options option run away aniety wouldnt allow got life leave option kill conscience wouldnt allow couldnt pain option hospital help figure dark feelings ego wouldnt allow couldnt stand thought eplaining people admitting things people hardly admit instead went bed net day started net week miserable life im going havent figured escape nothingness im suffocating

7442,"Hey,

I've been depressed ever since I hit puberty (\~15 years ago). I had a bad childhood (uncaring parents and I've experienced emotional and physical abuse by them), which I guess is what lead to my depression.

I've always struggled with building friendships and relationships. I've always felt like no one enjoys my company and that I'm the least favorite among the group and in general, I've always felt like a burden to people. 

I've tried taking antidepressants and sleeping pills for anxiety (started with zopiclone and zoloft, didn't really feel better for the short time I've been taking them). Now I've been taking deanxit for about 2 years. 

I felt like I was getting better (with some mild depressive moods), but overall I felt like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

The thing is, I tend to feel even worse when I get in a relationship. So, this is my first relationship ever since I started taking deanxit and oh boy, it is not any different. I always feel like I'm not good enough, that people would be better without me and most importantly, I don't feel happy and satisfied in the relationship. And I don't even know why. I've been dating someone for 3 months, and even though they are too busy with work, they try to make time for me and actually listen to me. They try to make things better and have a good time with me, despite of the fact that they don't really understand what depression is (they try to help me but I can't properly explain what is in my head).  

However, I feel like the more they try, the more unsatisfied I feel. It's like I want more and more and I don't even know what is this that I want so much. I get easily frustrated with my partner and the second they don't pay attention to me, I tend to feel angry with them. I know people show their feelings in different ways and I usually am a pretty grateful person, but for some reason I always crave something and feel incomplete in a relationship. Things are getting even worse since my SO gets irritated with my moods  and thus, my SO started distancing themselves. And in times like these, I need more reassurance, which I don't get and in the end, we get into a fight and now it feels like its end of our relationship since it feels like a never ending circle.

I don't know what's wrong with me honestly.  I am tired of fucking it up and letting valuable people go. Is there anyone else feeling like that? Why is this happening? How can I prevent in the future?",1,hey ive depressed hit puberty 15 years ago bad childhood uncaring parents ive eperienced emotional physical abuse guess lead depression ive struggled building friendships relationships ive felt like enjoys company im favorite group general ive felt like burden people ive tried taking antidepressants sleeping pills aniety started zopiclone zoloft didnt feel better short time ive taking ive taking deanit 2 years felt like getting better mild depressive moods overall felt like light end tunnel thing tend feel worse relationship relationship started taking deanit oh boy different feel like im good people better importantly dont feel happy satisfied relationship dont know ive dating 3 months busy work try time actually listen try things better good time despite fact dont understand depression try help cant properly eplain head feel like try unsatisfied feel like want dont know want easily frustrated partner second dont pay attention tend feel angry know people feelings different ways usually pretty grateful person reason crave feel incomplete relationship things getting worse gets irritated moods started distancing times like need reassurance dont end fight feels like end relationship feels like ending circle dont know whats wrong honestly tired fucking letting valuable people got feeling like happening prevent future

7474,"I've struggled living with depression for long as I can remember, since I was really little I was hypersensitive and melancholic. My family have never taken it seriously (I'm in my early thirties now) and I've had many moments on the brink where I've had to talk myself out of suicide,which gets harder and harder. Lately my brain immediately and automatically defaults to suicide at even the tiniest little obstacle. I feel pathetic and melodramatic and I can't really discuss it with anyone. I've had counselling, therapy, I'm on medication, and over the years I've developed a few coping mechanisms, but I've also managed to find a system that seems to work for me in controlling bad thoughts. So I thought until a few days ago. I did so well for so long, but for the last few days I just can't see that light at the end of the tunnel and it feels like I'm trapped in someone else's life. I can't discuss it with family or with my partner because my family are douchebags and I don't want to hurt my partner's feelings. I'm so tired, and I feel like an alien, and I'm just don't see any point or meaning in living. I look at others who I know aren't struggling with their mental health (people who know I'm depressed and have confessed that they can't relate} and wonder what it could feel like to not constantly think about killing yourself and have hope. I'm scared to truly open up or be honest about myself or my thoughts or feelings because I dread driving my friends away.

However, for all the middle class people who already have their basic needs met (or for teens/kids who do not have to worry about money yet), do you think money could directly improve your mental health?

In this case, I wish I was rich so that I can keep isolating myself and keep avoiding people who I do not wanna be around. Having to act like I am fine or like I enjoy following rules makes me anxious and more depressed and lonely. In this case, I do not think money would cure my depression but it would prevent me from falling into the deeper depression that comes with having to fit into a mold and caring about others' opinions of me. The excessive, unnecessary material things that people associate with wealth would not make me happy but having the financial stability and freedom to spend my time however I want around whoever I want would certainly remove a lot of my anxiety.

7488,"I'm just going to write idc 

I suffer with depression and other disorders but despite that i just want to enjoy living my life doing things i like

I genuinely liked to play volleyball, even though ive never played on teams or had anyone other than myself to play with

Instead of mindlessly slapping the ball i decided to start practicing skills when quarantine started. and i actually got better. But then i moved highschools and towns and then the peak of my depression insued

i wanted to die so bad, i had nothing i wanted to live for. everything just felt so hopeless. i stopped doing things i liked, and i stop practicing for about a year

needless to say, recently i found the incentive to get off my ass, and became more productive 

i found out my school was doing volleyball tryouts, and even though i havent touched the sport in months, i wanted to challenge myself and see if i could make the team. I am aware my skills are very mediocre, but i wanted to finally have a place i could go to improve my skills. 

but yeah, no shit i didnt make it. and even though i expected it, the more i think about it the more i want to rip my limbs off. I tried hard trying to get back into volleyball with the resources i had. I had to serve, pass, and set all by myself because i had no friends who wanted to play with me. I've been wanting to joing a club or hire a coach, but i know damn well i dont have the money. It feels like i couldve done more but i didnt. and it feels like im not privileged enough to play the damn sport. i dont want to give up. its so fun, but i cant imagine improving by just passing the ball to myself over and over again. I'm thinking of asking my mom to let me join a club (costs money, ofc), but i get to frustrated thinking about all those kids who are younger than me who were allowed to join clubs and sharpen their skills from young ages and were supported by their parents. I cant help but feel like theres no reason for me to get started now. Im a sophmore in high school and if i were to try out next year as a junior, i wouldnt be enough. 

I went out of my way to become eligible for tryouts. I canceled my doctor appointment that day (paid a no-show fee), went to the doctor last minute to get my physical, and spent days practicing nonstop. I cant help but feel ashamed and embarrased. people i know were rooting for me, and now it feels like they just pity me. I'd figure i'd be actually good at this damn sport by now, but nope. 

and what are the chances of me catching covid while training with other people? i just cant win. all that echos in my head is ""its not fair, its not fair."" 

i just want to be passionate about something. i want to be good at something for once. i want to be cheered on. and the idea of pursuing this dream any further is just making me bitter. 

it feels like nothing is in my favor. i just have to be satisfied being bored of my life.

7542,"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow. 
I really don't think I can't make it another day.",1,trappedhello kind read listen troubles truly wonder hear suicidal person im end rope severe depression aniety plagued 10 26 grew abusive home developed agoraphobia tandem mental illnesses rules life idea bad aniety failed classes scared leave seat turn work living childhood cat died year half ago event long figured mark demise ready kill shortly passing days spent preparation met amazing person boyfriend year lot help lose job si months ago boyfriend horrid upstairs neighbors consistently deprive sleep insomnia itwas issue know days entirely comprised trying sleep im scared leave house miserable constantly incredibly stressed neighbors feel completely trapped fear dying way moved mom briefly having daily companionship boyfriend saw mental state unravel worse neighbors love run away live car homeless im dependent medication unfortunately opiates opiates counteract horrible thing called akathisia tried killing wretched disorder twice opiates brought miraculous relief theyre obviously doubleedged sword cant meds undoubtedly end suicide eperiencing depression unleashed im stuck job home despise scared leave substance dependence wont allow freedom im afraid zero future prospects general list listed wrong head life post lengthy dont want hurt boyfriend family cant life thought today long got spend time boyfriend waiting week agonizing time desperate die came home headache straight bed works long tomorrow dont think cant day

7557,"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 

Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.

Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 

I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?

Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:

\- I'm ugly and overweight

\- I'm shy and introvertic

\- I'm bad at having conversations

\- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)

\- etc.

It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.

For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge.",1,im wont enjoyable lifefirstly im sorry bad english im native speaker im 18 years old boy ive planning commit suicide couple months probably fact doesnt want hurt mother friend maybe youre wondering young lad like willing ask shouldnt happiness future think person consciously unconsciously seeking happiness whats point living hope happy man dont know happiness isnt destined capable reach matter theres good thing waiting period perceive happiness different thing happiness comes social interactions making different people happy sound little bit ironic considering fact cope terrible aniety general awkwardness introversion maybe thats reason want commit suicide happiness comes thing im able thinking writer thats way right people enjoy books fine theres problem im good work enjoy writing whats fucking point doesnt reach wider public secondly know sound kind cheesy dont think reach happiness having girlfriend having like impossible impossible reasons im ugly overweight im shy introverted im bad having conversations im kind weirdo dont like generic music stuff etc painful women love fucking painful man se dont fuck se quickly jerk lust gone love comes end im gonna wish someday gain braveness finally jump bridge
7558,"Please just let it be overAlright time to vent because I’ve been bottling shit up for weeks and I have no one that I trust in my life to talk about at least not anymore. If you’re here for coherent thought probably not going to find it here. 

I seriously don’t even know what I’m doing anymore I’ve been scraping through university I actually have more fails then passes at this point and I’m in my second year. Pretty sure I’ve failed every subject this semester and I didn’t need to. But I can’t help myself I’m self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on track…. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didn’t well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when I’m spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be I’m obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. I’m your close friend when I need support but if you need it I’m not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships I’m so done. 

So I’ll probably fail this course no surprise I don’t really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isn’t the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother I’d rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. I’ve always been a coward because there’s always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I don’t care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now I’ve re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They don’t know what it’s like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter. 

I just want it to end this life of mine its not worth enduring any longer all is for naught.

It was during an online class when I decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph. Keep in mind we can't enable cameras. Afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep( this might sound stupid af) and it sounded like I started yawing for a second (it wasn't yawing). After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it. Around the end I hear a message notification and after I ended the paragraph and I muted my mic I opened my phone and saw the message. It was a gif( this gif: [https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF](https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF)) and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone. I ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing. After that i asked my self, DID THEY REALLY THOUGHT I WAS YAWING. You may think this a stupid reason to make a post. But the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted. Also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before, I'm really tired of it.

7609,"Last night I snapped. I wasn't even as angry/depressed as I have been. I just decided, you know what, fuck everything I'm gonna die.  We had a little argument but nothing noteworthy. I went to bed crying and stopped in the kitchen to grab a bottle of pills. I was in our room going back and forth between ""this is a stupid idea"" and ""just get it over with"". I finally just swallowed everything in one gulp and rolled over to fall asleep forever. About 11:30pm I started to feel very strange and for some reason opened my phone to text my husband that I was taking myself out of the equation. I started to write some notes to people I love.  That's when I started to regret what I had done. I began to think about all the people who I would hurt by doing this. I thought about the things i had yet to do that I've always wanted to.  I thought about my pets.  I thought about how to reverse it.  

The rest of my memories come in flashes.
The next thing I knew i heard my husband yelling,  ""What did you take!?"" Then someone tapping my leg and yelling my name. I am grabbing someone's hands and I fall. I hear the stretcher being drawn up into the ambulance. Someone tells me they are drawing blood. I hear them say my husband will be coming in. A nurse is yelling at me for something and I remember my legs hurting so badly. When I wake up enough they have me talk to a social worker. I'm immediately uncomfortable that I'm in my pajamas and no bra. I notice the hospital gown is thrown over me and i have no blanket. I wonder why nobody is taking care of me. 

I'm awake now and I realize it is 4:30 in the morning. The last thing I recall is sending the text. I am a little annoyed that nobody is looking after me. I keep thinking, do they even know how many pills I took?? They want to admit me but i convince them not to. We go home and go to bed.

This morning it all seems so surreal. Did that even happen? Why didn't anyone care? Was it a dream? Then I ask my husband what happened and the things he says are what changed my entire perspective.

 He found me unresponsive. He said I was pale and slurring. The paramedics got there and gave me a shot to bring me out and it didnt work. They kept slapping me and yelling my name. They used smelling salts but I kept passing out. They were talking to me about my daughter and I said I didn't care at that moment, anyone who knows me knows she is my world.  That was when they took me to the hospital. I couldn't walk so they had to help my through the tiny hallways to where they could get a stretcher. I couldn't spell my own name. They wouldn't let my husband come with me because he needed to fill out the police report. The cop told him I wouldn't know if he was there or not and he was right.  The hospital wouldn't let him in the room at first either.  Before he even saw me they had drawn blood, given me an IV, hooked me up to monitors for my heart, and done multiple tests. I didn't realize he was in the room until hours later. He said I ripped off all of my monitors and the nurse was yelling at me to keep them on. The thing that haunts me the most is that i cannot remember 5 hrs of my life. Him telling me all of this broke my heart.  I cannot believe that I put him through that.  Knowing he had to watch that makes me sick.  He is forever going to have that image of me in his mind and i cannot take that back.  I cannot get back those hrs i lost.  I'm embarrassed.  I'm ashamed that I thought it would be an easy way out without ever thinking about the consequences of those who would find me. I had instant regret when it was too late to help myself reverse it.  Thankfully it didn't work.  I feel so guilty for the trauma i put those people through.  I know for a fact now that I will NEVER do that again. It isn't worth it.  It isn't easy.  And I'll forever be traumatized by those 5 missing hours. 

TLDR: I tried to kill myself and it didn't work but the 5hrs i am now missing scared me enough that I value my life more than ever.

7612,"I want to talk about suicide without it being a jokeRecently my MDD has kicked in again. Around Easter is always a shit time of year. I'm graduating college soon and I actually have my life mostly planned out, just not implemented yet. I still can't help but feel hopeless and like there's no point. I'm the kind of person that jokes about killing myself or wanting to die. Partially because I mean it and partially because I don't want to be some downer to people around me. My friends who know I've struggled with depression get a little worried about me, but not enough to do much, though I don't know what the hell they could do. 

The last time I openly admitted to wanting to kill myself, my psychiatrist (not counselor) had me admitted to a mental hospital, twice. My closest friend, who I also have a crush on (gay) is the person I want to talk to about this stuff the most, but I feel like he's tired of me. He's the RA of my residence hall and if I'm honest with him about suicide, without just joking, he'd mandated to report it and it's back to the hospital with me. Which I can't do right now because I need to finish my degree and it doesn't help that much anyway.

7613,"Hope everyone in here is doing alright themselves.

I am at a totally different point in my life today than I would have ever guessed at the start of the year.

Going into 2021 and for the first few months of 2021, most things were right for me. Focused in school, working a part time job, going to the gym regularly, eating good, in an amazing relationship with the most amazing girl in the whole world, and I had gotten accepted into my dream school for this coming fall semester. had some serious issues with a few people at school but I learned to deal with it and my girlfriend was by my side through it all. I guess you could say I had most things going right for me, but was dying to get out of high school because it was a mess at times.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this past May, I am in the middle of exams at school which are stretched over a 3 week period when I'm sitting at a red light and get rear ended by a car going full speed.

I was sobbing, this was my breaking point and at that moment, I knew everything was going to go downhill for me. I also knew I was going to do horribly on my exams now. I had already overcome a stressful school year, and this was the cherry on top. In the moment of the accident, I didn't have any serious injuries at the moment besides a busted lip and loose front teeth, but I spent the next week or so crying through my exams just angry with my luck this school year. 

A week later, I started feeling like shit from the accident. Feeling nauseous and slow, terrible headaches. Awful pain in my back and neck, lip still hurting from the bruise and front teeth loose and in pain as well. Spend the next few weeks in pain, come to find out I have a bad herniated disc in my c spine and a muscle tear in my neck which can take up to a year and a half to heal, I was devastated. 

Started physical therapy a couple months ago and seeing a ton of different doctors for all the issues now, and today my back and neck are worse than when it firs started. Feeling pain and tingling in my arms and legs from it, I feel like it's never going to get better after 3 months of no improvement.

Because I am not doing any better present day from my injuries, I had to turn down my dream school and go to a shitty college close to home so I can continue therapy and keep my doctors.  I worked so hard this whole year to get into that school, just for everything to get tossed out by this accident which was not even my fault, just wrong place wrong time. I won't ever get over the work I put in this year through all the stress just to not be able to go to the school I was so excited about and looked forward to for so long.

In June, I find out one of my old coworkers took his own life. We weren't super close, but I cared for him a lot and loved him as a person. I will never forgive myself for not reaching out to him and checking up on him after he quit the job. Maybe he just needed to know that somebody was there for him and cared for him. I know it isn't my responsibility, but who knows. I can't let this guilt go, I should have done something for him and I didn't, and now it is probably my biggest regret ever.

&#x200B;

In the middle of this timeframe between the accident and now, I have also had a couple of heated arguments with my girlfriend, both being my fault for the most part. I have gotten so sensitive and will get mad over anything, pushing away the people I love and care for most. Luckily we were able to get through it, but they were pointless and a result of me being bitchy, possibly because my doctors have prescribed me 7 different medicines and different combinations  I feel like I'm spiraling out of control.

Another benefit of my dream school was being close to my girlfriend and where she's going. Now I won't be as close, and I'm stuck at home for the year. She has been my rock through it ALL since the start of our relationship March of 2020. I don't know where I would be without her today, she has done everything for me and supported me through everything. She was there for me when nobody else was. She stood up for me when nobody else would, and she spends so much of her energy caring for me and looking out for me. She deserves the world. But she leaves for school next week and I'm terrified to keep on going without her by my side. I'm scared that our relationship will fail since we are kind of far away, and that is the absolute last thing I need. I need her support, even if she's half way across the country. I need for her to be there with me, because I don't think I can keep going through this alone for who knows how long. I have cried myself to sleep late into the night wondering how I can keep going with everything just seeming to get worse for me. Nothing is going my way anymore and it feels like it wont for a long time.

My plan now is to spend this year going to college close to home, that way I can recover fully and then transfer to a much better school where I would be much happier. So I guess I can see when things will start falling back into place. I just need to fully recover soon, transfer, hope my girlfriend is still with me, and things will start to work out. But it's such a long road ahead, and everyday I think about how I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I've lost all happiness and have nothing encouraging me.

&#x200B;

Any comments will help, seriously. The smallest words of kindness will go a long way for me. I just needed to let this all out. I hope things work out eventually, but it's a long ways away. 

If you made it this far, it means more to me than I could ever say. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I don't get any pleasure, motivation, or excitement from anything anymore. I used to have intense desire to draw, play video games, explore, etc. All those motivating feelings stopped as I entered my teen years (I'm now 28). I was on SSRIs as a kid and motivation wasn't an issue. It was mainly for suicidal tendencies and anxiety from my depression. However, since about 15 it's been a steep decline to Anhedonia. 

What I've done. 
I've bounced around all major SSRIs, and combined them with Wellbutrin XL to no avail. 
I've done lifestyle changes where I joined a gym and went at it 4 times a week for a year and gained 30lbs of muscle. 
I would get more sunlight.
Push myself into social gatherings with my best friends. 

Currently I'm back to 40mg prozac, but the only thing it helps is the darkened/suicidal thoughts. I just want to enjoy life again. It's been so long that I've forgotten what it's like.

7630,"Had shotgun off safety, in my mouth today.I'm a targeted individual.  I've been tortured, followed (from city to city), slandered, attacked by every conceivable mental torture possible.  Hearing voices, seeing holograms, robbed of intellectual and physical property.  Too long to list.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

My sister called the cops on me a few months ago for being suicidal and telling her off.  I got a felon with a gun charge.  They can give me 5 to 40 years in prison.  I'm not going back to fucking prison.  I've been before and can't stand being around convicts who actually belong there.

And nobody ever apologized or feels any remorse for the things they do to me.

So I was going to do it today but everyone was coming over tonight, I was trying to hurry but scared.  I heard a noise, looked out the window, and it was my mom coming home from church.

So I'm waiting until I know for sure one of my nieces or nephews won't be here when they find me.

I still get out of bed and try every day though. Some days are better than others. Today was amazing. Spent the entire day with a beautiful girl. Her laugh and smile made me laugh and smile. Yet here I am at 1am with suicidal thoughts. I fight a losing  battle every fucking day man. Things aren’t getting any easier. I’ve realized I have no passions. No hobbies. No real drive for anything in life. I feel so lost everyday. I don’t know how much longer I can hold out honestly. The only reason I haven’t jumped off a building yet is because it would ruin my family. I love my little sisters and I know how much it would impact their lives to attend the funeral of their big brother. Guys your big brother is trying, I really am.

She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn’t work and she decides to kill herself “she’s tried her best”. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I’m doing is trying to help. Her reactions aren’t that of a normal person so it’s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don’t make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I can’t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can’t be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her?

About 10 months ago I started experiencing a lot of unpleasant physical sensations in my body, like for example my chest and stomach are always burning up and my head as well, just my entire body feels inflamed. I went to the hospital twice, I went to several doctors to check me , I did blood tests, I started taking vitamins, I’m trying to improve my diet again after 11 months of binging and eating like shit because of an unholy amount of stress. This has only been adding to my suffering even more. I was getting on and off suicidal for the last months since this started because each day I think I’m going to die, and since I started obsessing about death I just couldn’t handle that thought so I became suicidal again. I had to do all my exams with this feeling, go through a depressive episode which I can’t seem to recover from, panic attacks every day, anxiety from literally anything I do and suicidal thoughts all at once., that are all untreated and got worse over the years. I’m literally just 18 and I feel like my body is collapsing. I’ve already had an illness and I’m TERRIFIED of getting it back because it will fuck up my health even more. Each day I vent to this to everyone I can, cause it’s just so overwhelming. I just don’t know what to do. I always think it’s my fault for feeling unwell and I don’t want to deal with another illness because I’m scared to death of them. Idk what to do :( most doctors just tell me it’s stress but I’ve been severely stressed since I was a child due to many things and I can’t seem to shake off that feeling 
I will do more tests in the following month , but even if they find something I just don’t want to deal with it. I’ve dealt with so many things on my own that it has become debilitating.

' and that kinda just, ruined me. i'm in a new school now but people from my old one talk to people at my new school so.. yeah lovely.. i don't wanna say i have depression but i think that i do, i have a doctors visit coming up, so i'll ask there. i just feel tired, exhausted, i feel more.. angered??, i have no reason to wake up anymore, it's hard for me to eat or do simple tasks like brushing my teeth, i have thought of suicide but i don't want my parents to get mad at me for trying. i don't even wanna tell my parents about the depression, if i have it. i'm scared of what they'd say to me, like would they be disappointed, will they treat me as if it was a lie, i'm not sure if i could exactly trust them either, my moms bestfriend gossips to everyone and she'd tell this bestfriend and everyone would know. my parents are also nagging me to clean my room but i have no motivation or anything to do it.

7753,"Hello, my name is Daniel, and I'm almost 26.. I've got a problem.. I got a problem with myself and my mentality.. for years I have been trying to fix myself, doing up and down, trying to fix myself and trying to find a hope somewhere up there, when you look up in the sky and you should see the clear blue sky but.. in stead I just see the dark and endless black open space. Even on cloudy days, where people try to find the sun, I don't manage to do that. I got several problems with myself, and the first one would be being way too judgmental with myself.. and it's something that's been going on for a very long time. The second problem would be self-hared / disappointment. I'm a guy and I have tried to do stuff for several times ( In regards with girls ) but I always fail. I have let myself and other people down so many times that I have just completely lost my mind and hope.

The only thing I ever wished for was being happy, and being happy is the main goal for at least 100% of the people on this planet. Everyone wants to be happy, doesn't matter if you're a robber, a serial killer, a politician or an hotel manager, we all want to be happy.

And I can't seem to find that G spot of life, being happy. every time I do something it happens with doubt, and with self questions, am I doing it right? What did I do wrong this time? Why can't I be normal like everyone else? and so on.

I don't know what I'm doing here posting this shit, but I have one request to whoever reads it.

I need help. And not the king of help you would expect. I want someone to help me get it over with, finish it, end it, get the job done.

Every minute being alive is like plain pain for me, and I don't like the way I feel and the way I make others feel with my disappointment. Please, if anyone is humane here, help me through what had to be done a long time ago.

I have a video and a WORD file ready on my computer, in case my family or friends find me like this, they'll know a little about my background story, because 99% of the people in my life know nothing about me, it was always hidden, always being put away to make myself seem normal.

I'm sorry if I ever did anything bad to hurt other people, I'm sorry to my family, if they had to deal with my shit. To my friends, who had to try and keep me up and going every time, to my lovers (if I can even call them one) who at least seemed to show some kind of concussion and carness about me.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

For not being good enough for this world, for being unable to cope with whatever is coming towards me, and for letting everyone I know, down.

I hope for the sake of myself and others, that this mistake (of choosing to live any longer and trying to find a hope in this shit life) will not happen again.

7813,"I had my first year of college last year, and I think it's safe to say most people thought it sucked. However, and I know this sounds dramatic, but something just broke me last year. I had a plan going into college, maybe not a solid one, but it was something. I wanted to socialize, study, just have a new experience. But after last year, having to suffer through a shitty online class system, and seeing my mental health just drop, I've done a little thinking.

I don't really have any passions in life. There's not really a lot of things I would consider myself passionate about, and even less so that I can turn into something I could monetize. The only thing I can think of is art and illustrating, but honestly, I actually don't really know if I want that to be my career. Yeah, if I can grow popular online and do commissions as a side gig, I'd love that, but I really don't wanna risk tainting one of the few things I still love to do by going into  the industry and turning that into a career. I'll be honest. I actually think I would be much happier just doing a regular 9-5 job than going into a major industry like medicine or something. I don't really want to be rich or famous. I just want enough to be content in life. My own home, bunch of video games and other nerd shit that I'd kill to have, and idk, a cat or something. I just don't really know if I wanna go through the entire process, only to end up with just a paper in a thing I don't want and a bunch of money in debt.

Obviously this is a huge decision, and I haven't made my final choice yet. Honestly, I'm terrified to even bring this up with my parents cause I feel like this will just make them even more mad and disappointed. I'll bring this up with my therapist next time, and maybe at least try to explain myself to my parents.

I just genuinely don't know if college is even for me anymore. Even if I end up missing put on a bunch of experiences, I just don't know if it's worth it in the end.",1,year college years think safe people thought sucked know sounds dramatic broke years plan going college maybe solid wanted socialize study new eperience years having suffer shitty online class system seeing mental health drop ive little thinking dont passions life theres lot things consider passionate turn monetize thing think art illustrating honestly actually dont know want career yeah grow popular online commissions gig id love dont wanna risk tainting things love going industry turning career ill honest actually think happier regular 95 job going major industry like medicine dont want rich famous want content life home bunch video games nerd shit id kill idea cat dont know wanna entire process end paper thing dont want bunch money debt obviously huge decision havent final choice honestly im terrified bring parents cause feel like mad disappointed ill bring therapist net time maybe try eplain parents genuinely dont know college anymore end missing bunch eperiences dont know worth end

7863,"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. It’s not the first time. I’ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I’d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn’t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn’t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasn’t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn’t take her son to school today. He didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn’t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I’d never finished school, how I didn’t have a job, how I didn’t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I’d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn’t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn’t I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn’t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, “Not yet. I can’t do that to my family.”

But I think about it now that I’m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.",1,im worthless bastardtoday contemplated killing time ive considered lot times life come reason family needs id miss new episode favorite longest time reason holding didnt want miss avengers infinity war endgame sounds stupid think saw wasnt thought going satisfied forgot long forgotten waiting movie end things wasnt today sitting couch peace genuinely content moment sister came mad didnt son school today didnt lot sleep night bad nightmare grandmother fathers recently passed decided let stay home wouldnt right send school sister confronted accused lazy said lay watch time brought things id finished school didnt job didnt friends thing world stupid action figures collected called worthless bastard said going grow old better epect care mother eventually dies worthless bastard hurt thinks worthless bastard sister waited left house cried got thinking life shes right dont friends dropped college care mom got sick dont degrees im 23 virgin ive boyfriend cause wanted ask home care provider mom fired changed insurances job money fill application places rejected interviews rejected im tired getting rejected hate life hate time leave house feel like laughing awful thinking hate know im irrational feel havent left house drop nephew school pick days dont car way dont face home hide smart think smart think goals plans life things wanted going doctor going college state plan id tell listen plans endured lot bullying growing people telling worthless going worthless remember grade ecluded games didnt friends bullying continued elementary middle school bullied school bullied home sister grandmother life told ugly stupid lazy couldnt right dumbass id cry called sensitive sensitive couldnt joke target days considered killing relief didnt stood mirror tears eyes said cant family think im older life told care sister mental disorder mom telling day doctor support sister look nightmares nightmares mom ghost telling look sister nephew look im didnt didnt prove wrong cant care im waste space worthless bastard like said feel worthless tired hate wish dead

""Just do it,"" they tell me. So i did.

I dont understand how its hard for other other people

Ive been feeling like that recently, now that i came to the generalization about gettinf easily influenced and stuff

If i tell myself to be happy, will i really be happy? Ill never know because i dont want to do that

I know very well that i will act on it once i get influenced by something.

Im scared that if i keep telling myself to be happy then i will be happy, because i am that kind of person

I dont want to do that, maybe if i become happy then my depression isnt real then, maybe i deceived people, maybe ive been living a lie, maybe im just a typical teen faking a mental illness for attention.....thats what ive came up with if i became happy.

7912,"I hate my health...I'm 20 years old, male, and I've got problems.  I grew up in an abusive family, and I'm still living here.  I'm about to postpone college so I can move out, but those are little things.

My health has been failing for the past several years.  I've developed a shit ton of food allergies... I can barely eat anything, and with what little I can, it's impossible to get all the vitamins needed for my body to function correctly... and that leads to even more problems, and it's alot more than you might think at first... The list of things I can eat is literally shorter than the list of things I can't.  Even trace amounts of food that I can't have will trigger a response.  If someone drinks out of something, then kisses me, I'm screwed for about 2 months.  At first, I'll be in pain.  The other symptoms are almost like having the flu, and then I'll be extremely tired.  Sometimes I'll pass out one day, and wake up two days later.  I'll be very tired like this for about a week to a month.  The pain will last a day, sometimes more, but it's the more visible effects that get to me the most.  The skin on my face will explode into pimples and my entire face will be covered with a red rash.  This is the part that lasts for about 2 months... I've been to 4 different allergy doctors, a dietitian, and a dermatologist, and none of them could help me.  The longer I avoid the foods, the worse the responses seem to be... and they're almost inevitable.  If a dish isn't washed well enough, I'll react to it.  If a knife was placed on a counter, I'll react to whatever it's used to cut.  Lots of fruits are covered in a corn based wax, which I react to, and even companies that I'm used to buying canned tomatoes or anything as basic as that will switch their ingredients before they switch the label, then there goes 2 months of my life.  If I react to something 1 out of every 100 days, then 60% of the time, I'll have to deal with these symptoms.  On top of that, I'm also diabetic.

It doesn't end there either.  If I get sick, it usually lasts about 5x-10x longer for me than for other people because my immune system is focused on tracking down pollen and food particles; so it doesn't invest anywhere near as much resources to fight bacteria and disease as a normal person's would.  I'd give more information, but I'm already pretty identifiable as it is.

7913,"Hello, to the person behind the screen. I don't know if you're real. (And sometimes, it sure doesn't feel like it). 

I've spent far too much time thinking, and it seems to get me nowhere. As Jean-Paul Sartre put it 'My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think… and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it's frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing'. 

In fact, nothing seems to feel ""real"". So what if it's not? Well, it wouldn't make a difference. We have to live the lives we live. And that's not exactly something that motivates me. What is there to live for? If I could, it would be nice (?) to live without a purpose and dwell at my own bidding. However, (unfortunately) society happens to be fairly difficult to escape from.

Logically, the best way out here is suicide. But then again, to quote Albert Camus: 'It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end'.

....

or perhaps I am going insane.",1,hello person screen dont know youre real sure doesnt feel like ive spent far time thinking jeanpaul sartre thought thats cant stop eist think cant stop thinking moment frightful eist horrified eisting fact feel real wouldnt difference live lives live thats eactly motivates live nice live purpose dwell bidding unfortunately society happens fairly difficult escape logically best way suicide quote albert cause easy logical impossible logical bitter ends going insane

BUT.. I'm shocked to not hear from any developers out there who may have had a hard time focusing at work because of their depression. Earlier in 2018, my concern was getting an okayish job alone, but now instead it's the job itself that gives me anxiety, and the impostor syndrome has engulfed my mind. Because it's work from home, I basically did nothing today. Several days I've worked a little too less. I'm not good at anything.



Of late, the shittiest thing in my life is that the only thing which I can find some pleasure in is orgasms which last for a fleeting moment, and then I feel guilty about being this way.

7933,"I am absolutely done with this world. I have spent my entire life and suffered homelessness, child abuse that involves incest, rape, molestation, beatings to the point I could barely move, bleeding, etc. 

I have endured a life of pure hell and its not getting easier. I also struggle with morbid obesity and fought with it for over 30 yrs. I am on a shit ton of meds that don't help for anything in the world. been denied 15 times for weight loss surgery.

Living on disability getting 800 a month to live on and in debt where 200 of my check goes to paying back the government from where they said they overpaid me on my disability check I owe them 9k, for the next 4 years. I have 3 credit cards I had to take out and use to get dental work and other things done medically that insurance wouldn't cover. 

I have no extra income. there are days I can barely get out of bed because of how badly my body hurts because of the weight and the arthritis I have in my lower back, knees, feet and ankles. 

most of my family are dead, my mom died when I was 25, my real dad when I was 23. I spent 10 yrs being homeless doing day labor for food or a bed to sleep in that night. 

I bought a car 4 years ago that took me 5 yrs to save 2k. got scammed by the dealership. still can't save any money to try to buy another vehicle to live in.

Bought a gaming laptop that got damaged during shipment with the first stimulus check a couple years ago and sent it back, the shipper accused me of the damage and refused to refund or replace the laptop. 

spent the past 12 years in the dating scene and all I get is rejected because of my weight. told I am disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone or a relationship. laughed at, mocked at, made fun of and even told to kill myself because I am a joke. lead on by women who are married or pretending to want to get to know me and then faking their death on me or calling me while having sex with someone, leading me on for months to years, pretending to be single but are really married.

since I was 18 all I have wanted was a good woman to love and build a life with, now here I am 40 and only had sex once via a hooker and found out, I do not enjoy sex without feelings or emotions and can't get hard because I didn't have feelings for her and don't enjoy casual sex. 

 

I have spent over 20 yrs without being touched, hugged, or anything by anyone. I went to the dentist about 4 years ago and the assistant did a cancer screening on me, which involved feeling around my neck, skull, jaw line etc and I ended up having to leave and broke down crying hysterically because it felt so amazing being touched by another human being for once in my entire life. 

I can't keep living a life like this fighting and struggling and for nothing in return and being treated as if I was some kind of monster. I am done living and done with this life. I can't keep living being alone and single, unloved, uncared for missing out in having a real relationship with a woman who I love and care for and her love and care for me. both of us being intimate with each other etc. 

I just can't live life anymore. so I am done, and I am about to end it. goodbye.",1,absolutely world spent entire life suffered homelessness child abuse involves incest rape molestation beatings point barely bleeding etc endured life pure hell getting easier struggle morbid obesity fought 30 yrs shit ton meds dont help world denied 15 times weight loss surgery living disability getting 800 month live debt 200 check goes paying government said overpaid disability check owe sky net 4 years 3 credit cards use dental work things medically insurance wouldnt cover etra income days barely bed badly body hurts weight arthritis lower knees feet ankles family dead mom died 25 real dad 23 spent 10 yrs homeless day labor food bed sleep night bought car 4 years ago took 5 yrs save sky got scammed dealership cant save money try buy vehicle live bought gaming laptop got damaged shipment stimulus check couple years ago sent shipper accused damage refused refund replace laptop spent past 12 years dating scene rejected weight told disgusting worthless useless told offer relationship laughed mocked fun told kill joke lead women married pretending want know faking death calling having se leading months years pretending single married 18 wanted good woman love build life 40 se hooker found enjoy se feelings emotions cant hard didnt feelings dont enjoy casual se spent 20 yrs touched hugged went dentist 4 years ago assistant cancer screening involved feeling neck skull jaw line etc ended having leave broke crying hysterically felt amazing touched human entire life cant living life like fighting struggling return treated kind monster living life cant living single unloved uncared missing having real relationship woman love care love care intimate etc cant live life anymore end goodbye

7975,I think sharing my story will help me find closure. I’m here to do something anyway. I have been struggling with intense depression and anxiety since freshman year of high school. I’ve hid it from my family and most of my friends. I’ve tried drugs and therapy but I hated it all. I’m 23 now I’m an engineer.  I have every blessing I could hope for but I feel like I take it for granted no matter how hard I try to be thankful I’d much rather kill myself or something. My family split up so I lived alone majority of high school resenting everyone. Even my friends I grew distant. I opened up to someone senior year and grew co dependent on her. I had no one else in my eyes. Even if it wasn’t true it didn’t feel right. We eventually cut ties after a long time for both our mental health’s. I was to much of a bother and She wasn’t who I needed in my life. Ever since I’ve been coasting through panic attacks and depression. Just living. It feels like a pain.  Eventually I felt the world grew gray and I didn’t wanna die anymore. What purpose is it for me to kill myself. I don’t even care if I do or don’t. If the option was laid before me I’d take it.  Shit I tried to give myself chlorine poisoning at some point. It was painful. After just nothing but shit in my life I met someone. That I grew to really like she was great she supported me even after I told her my story. But thats just what I thought. It was just another person trying to pass time to them it feels like I feel like I grew attached again we broke things off and here I am. I feel lost Incomplete and unnoticed. Even when I try to reach out I’m met with silence. I’m not suicidal. The pain of this is probably the worst I’ve felt in a long time. To feel like the one person who truly understood me. And said so much to me and promised me. And to get no reason why but to feel like nothing more than a toy to the person I trusted. It just made my feelings on it all come back. And I did snap on them and I tried to apologize for it but nothing happens but silence. That’s my story so far. I skipped a lot but it’s where I am.,1,think sharing story help find closure im struggling intense depression aniety freshman year high school ive hid family friends ive tried drugs therapy hated im 23 im engineer blessing hope feel like granted matter hard try thankful id kill family split lived majority high school resenting friends grew distant opened senior year grew co dependent eyes wasnt true didnt feel right eventually cut ties long time mental healths bother wasnt needed life ive coasting panic attacks depression living feels like pain eventually felt world grew gray didnt wanna die anymore purpose kill dont care dont option laid id shit tried chlorine poisoning point painful shit life met grew like great supported told story thats thought person trying pass time feels like feel like grew attached broke things feel lost incomplete unnoticed try reach im met silence im suicidal pain probably worst ive felt long time feel like person truly understood said promised reason feel like toy person trusted feelings come snap tried apologize happens silence thats story far skipped lot

7985,"Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub-reddit to post it to. I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow. Apologies for the long post.

I had started working at a company where I [30M] met K [30M]. We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay. Now, he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay. In fact, he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret. This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life. A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person. Furthermore,hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows. 

He has his personal issues why he doesn't want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades. However, I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting.

Honestly, when he first told me about his secret, I tried my best to be laid back about it. I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend. Admittedly, I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting 'love you' or 'xx'. I guess, from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends. However, I (naively) saw nothing wrong in that. 

Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him. Because of this, we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO. He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with. Whilst I enjoy his company, many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely. This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding.

He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often. He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life. I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem. On one hand I wish to keep him in my life, but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this. 

One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience. I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend.

I honestly do not know what to do. Did I do something wrong?

Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

7992,"My final goodbyeIt’s come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that I will ever have the life that I’ve been trying to manifest for the last decade and I’m simply not okay with that. I’m no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and I’m not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. It’s become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. I’ve been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I can’t seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - I’m so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - It’s been literally my entire fucking life. I don’t remember a time that I wasn’t in debt and I don’t remember a time that I haven’t been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we’re born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we’re ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. I’ve had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. I’ve done stupid things, said stupid things and I’ve hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. It’s unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could’ve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of “I should’ve or could’ve or would’ve” done something had I only known how bad he was. 
I’m so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. I promise that no matter what I will always look out for all of you from the other side. 
I love you 
R ✌️
PS please do NOT have a funeral for me. I don’t want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. Also, I wouldn’t bother dealing with the CRA or the bankruptcy. You’ll only find insurmountably crushing debt that’s pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me I’ve tried. I’m so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody. I have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this.
Again, I’m so sorry. I just can’t live like this anymore.",1,final goodbyeits come realization recently zero chance life ive trying manifest decade im simply okay im closer success today 20 years ago im going spend rest life hoping praying visualizing life tolerable magically happen painfully clear visualization bullshit tired struggling having ive debt literally entire adult life bankruptcies cant shit time try new dig way goes hell constant repeated failure longer acceptable longer live debt erased regardless try im tired overwhelming stress comes literally entire fucking life dont remember time wasnt debt dont remember time havent stressed finances universe decided allowed successful financially literally works regardless want hard try year ago spiritual awakening realization connected consciousness eternal time earth temporary believe choose lives everybody mission spelled born bonds create earth actually created long conceived predestined mission life universe push direction need given free order achieve life mission ive lot amazing opportunities life completely fucked recover ive stupid things said stupid things ive hurt people supposed walk life unfortunate know achieved great things right partner proper support got tired waiting proud ask help point time reset know absolutely anybody close couldve prevent literally absolutely reason feel bad thought shouldve couldve wouldve known bad im sorry family friends nephews promise matter look love funeral dont want anyones money spent ridiculous party celebrate failed life wouldnt bother dealing cra bankruptcy youll find insurmountable crushing debt thats pretty unerasable believe ive tried im sorry passing caused financial strain anybody offer financially maybe sell belongings cover epenses come im sorry cant live like anymore

Although I've been able to reach this state of nothingness before, a numbness to all emotional ties, trying to do it with you seems to be impossible.
