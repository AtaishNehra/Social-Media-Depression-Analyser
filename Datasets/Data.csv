"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2324,doqwow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,175,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0,1
"Regular Check-In Post, with important reminders about the No Private Contact and No Activism rules",674,m246c4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/m246c4/regular_checkin_post_with_important_reminders/,2584,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  

It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*

**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read /r/depression/wiki/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources.",1615399694.0,1

"I want some serious advice, I'm considering checking myself into a mental hospital.",15,oz1joe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz1joe/i_want_some_serious_advice_im_considering/,1,"So I've struggled with mental illness basically my entire life. I've been in therapy for more than a decade. Recently it occurred to me that I actually can't remember how it feels to not be depressed and in my case, also dissociatiated.

It's not my first time being hospitalized. I was once when I was 14 or 15 and then when i was 16 i was in a weird sorta half school/ half mental hospital clinic place.

I'm just not sure if I should do it. Mostly because I'm worried I might lose my job or something, because I'm in no shape to actually contact them and figure out the paperwork.

At the same time. I just spent the last 45 minutes picking up and putting down a knife just debating if I want to feel something or not. I can't get myself to eat, because the idea of it finally being over is so comforting. I'm afraid to drive, because I'll give into temptations. I'm just so tired of trying.

I also think I'm constantly making up excuses because even though I think I need help I don't really want it. I'm just shutting down to everyone. 

So how does someone go about self admitting? And if I can't get myself to do this, is there a way I can get someone or something to force me to do it?",1628233296.0,1

I went to the hospital and things got so much worse.,7,oz1lmn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz1lmn/i_went_to_the_hospital_and_things_got_so_much/,1,"Here. Imma paste a wall of text that I typed elsewhere and try to make some slight edits.


I was admitted to the mental health unit Wednesday night. Dr Santin met with me on Thursday morning. We talked about what meds I’m on. He remarked that I’m on a lot of meds. This is true. He wanted to reduce them. This sounds like a bad idea. He talked about my steroids and pain management meds.


I had to give him a talk on adrenal insufficiency. What it is, how it works, how it is treated. 

[adrenal insufficiency is when your adrenal glands don’t make cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone and it is crucial to life. If you do not make cortisol, you have to replace it with steroids.  Now I am steroid-dependent]

While I was talking to him, I did mention that I had changed endocrinologists. That’s why my steroid dosage was slightly different from what was in the system. That was what the old Endo had me on (for the record, I went from 10/5 to 10/5/2.5 a day). 

I really didn’t think much of the conversation. I didn’t test him afterward to make sure he had a basic understanding. I just assumed that if he had any relevant questions he would ask. He didn’t ask me anything and we moved on to my autism diagnosis. He told me that i do not have autism and I have BPD. I explained to him that autism is not a subjective observation, but rather an objective diagnosis and that I was diagnosed by Dr M, PhD.  He argued with me at length.

So later that day they ask me to sign a form authorizing contact with my Endocrinologist. Only it says “OldEndoFirst NewEndoLast.”  So I correct the nurse. I explain that Dr J is my old doctor and Dr B is my current provider. She fills out a new form with my correct Endo on it. 

The next day I did not meet with the psych. I met with Mary, PA. She informed me that we were going to be titrating down on the steroids. I said no. She told me that Dr Santin consulted with the internal medicine provider at the hospital who said it was appropriate. I told her no. I said he needed to consult with an endocrinologist. She then backtracked to say that my Endo had been called and was on board with this.  She also mentioned something about Dr Staub. I don’t know who that is. 

I called Dr B. It was about 3 pm on a Friday. I explained to the nurse that they were trying to titrate me down and I needed my doc to call the hospital. Gave her the unit that I was on, number to the nursing station, name of the doctor and PA. They said they’d call me back. I was doubtful because it was 3 pm. They didn’t call me. 

Saturday morning I met with an Judy, APRN. She didn’t even bother to pretend she had my records on the screen in front of her. She has this notebook. She informed me that I was not steroid-dependent and I didn’t need steroids so they were going to taper me off of them. I told her that I am steroid dependent, that I was diagnosed in that very hospital back in January and have been following with an Endo ever since. They gave me 7.5 mg that morning instead of 10 mg to start the tapering. 

So I kicked up a fuss. I called my friend who works at that hospital. I asked her what to do. On Friday at 2 pm I had tried to sign out AMA and as a result was put on a 48-hour psychiatric hold. Meaning I couldn’t leave until 2 pm Sunday. So my friend told me to 1. Find out which internal medicine doc was consulted 2. Get a patient advocate and 3. File a grievance. She also told me that Dr M, who diagnosed me with AI, happened to be on duty at the time. 

I went to the nurses station and asked for the patient advocate. They instead called the nursing manager. While I was waiting for him, Judy met with me again. I told her the name of the doc who diagnosed me. I told her he is working right now. She got really pissed and demanded to know how I knew that. She did not contact him. 

The nursing manager told me that if I signed out AMA they would be required to call the police for a welfare check and that if the police thought I was a danger I could be locked up in the crisis center for 48 hours. I told him I’d roll the dice. 

Judy came in again and told me how being on steroids was bad for me and they were doing this to help me. By then I had been under-dosed and over-stressed and could barely stay upright. I demanded to go home. They eventually said they’d get my paperwork started. Five hours later I got home. 

So now I am supposed to get a call from a patient advocate tomorrow. I plan on raising hell. I’ve looked through my chart. For one, not everything that should be in there is in there. Either it’s restricted so I can’t see it, or the doctor just didn’t bother to document his time with me. 

They replaced my AI diagnosis with “factitious disorder imposed on self.”  It notes that I am claiming to have Addison’s disease (I always said adrenal insufficiency) and that I choose to take steroids and increase my dose by myself because it makes me feel good. It says that they contacted some random pain specialist I’ve never heard of about my steroid use.  Somehow Dr Santin thinks I was using steroids to treat my pain. Apparently they may have called my old Endo, Dr J, as well. 

I called new Endo on Monday morning. They had no record of ever being contacted by the hospital. 

And for the record, “factitious disorder imposed on self” is another name for Munchausens Syndrome. 

I have removed names, but left in Dr Santin because he deserves to be called out in public forums whenever possible. He nearly caused me serious harm. And he never did treat my depression. I left far worse than when I checked in.",1628233541.0,1
I’ve never thought about killing myself but i want to just die so bad,4,oz2n7d,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz2n7d/ive_never_thought_about_killing_myself_but_i_want/,1,"I don’t like attention, or trying to get someone to “care” . I’m pretty independent and it’s relative because this is somewhat out of my comfort zone to even post something like this, I don’t like discussing my problems and am a master of masking. No one even knows how I’m feeling, mainly Becuase I haven’t spoken to my dad in 4 months and my mom believes anything can be changed with the power of mindset and manifestation. Which is utter bullshit because if that was the case I wouldn’t be like this. The downward spiral in the past 4 months is due to a fight me and my father got into, and it still is just as bad as it was a while ago. He’s very manipulative, impossible to please, high standards, strict. He’s a military man. And this causes a lot of issues in the household, and for context my parents are divorced. He holds things over my head financially, and uses it as a control mechanism. He is unbelievably controlling, and interacting with him feels so detrimental to my mental health, but everyone in my family says I can’t just cut him off. Anyways, on to the point I’ve been living at my moms for a few months now and despite the long distance controlling hes been trying to do I’ve been enjoying living here, which is nice. The problem is my mental state has sharply declined in the past few weeks and it gets worse every day. 

I feel like breathing, getting out of bed and going somewhere is a chore that I despise doing. Especially the breathing part. I have not nor will I consider suicide as I don’t find it logical, but that’s just me. Instead I’ve been doing some questionable things because I want to die but like, I don’t wanna kill myself. I wish someone would just rob me at gunpoint and shoot me or something. I can’t take the pain that is literally waking up because it feels like such a big weight on my shoulders. To be honest I don’t even have a main reason for feeling this way, some say it’s their job , their dead end lives, a girl/boy, love, all of that, but I just don’t feel anymore. I used to accelerate and close my eyes in the car as a joke with friends but now I do it almost every time I get into the car, just hoping that I will be taken someday. I can’t even cry or feel anything and I forgot how to smile or frown. I just sit there, with a blank stare. Trying to pass time or counting the seconds in my head. If I had to pin point a reason for feeling this way I’d say the best comparison is like, stress to a insane degree.. is that a thing? I’m just so stressed about everything and anything these days and I’m so out of it that I eat like one meal a day *if I remember* and all I want is to feel alive again and not have to worry about trying to die from some statistic every day. This isn’t necessarily a cry for help. I just don’t know where to put this. So here it is. I apologize if this is a little all over the place, I have trouble putting big thoughts on paper.",1628238888.0,1

What's it like not hating yourself?,61,oyosku,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyosku/whats_it_like_not_hating_yourself/,17,"I have friends who say that they love themselves, that they think they're attractive and worthwhile. And when they say that, all I can think is how, how can someone love themselves or even think of themselves positively. I can barely think of one major positive thing about myself. I have hated myself ever since I was 9 and it has never let up for the past decade.

My self hatred is so engrained that when friends or family tell me something positive about me, it's like my mind completely blocks it out, and it's even worse when I get into a depressive headspace. Because I believe that they're lying or they're saying so out of pity and they don't mean it. Positive self talk feels wrong on every level and I need constant validation for everything.

I look at my body and all I can see is what's wrong with it and how ugly it is. I reflect on myself and all I see is weakness, slobishness, selfishness, stupidity and inadequacy. I look at all the skills I've acquired and all I see is a string of failures, and again, inadequacies. I'm bad at everything I do. I'm constantly scared that my friends are going to find someone better and replace me with them so whenever I feel threatened in that way I act out and make things worse.

I'm super weak and I know that. I know I don't deserve anything good in this life and I know that I'm fat, ugly, and undesirable. And I know this mindset just makes it worse by the day but at this point its grown so dark and powerful that I can't stop it. I'm too weak to stop it.

I know I need major help, I just dont know where to get it, I just want it to stop.

You'll be laying there fantasizing about sleeping on a futon. There's no risk when you go after a dream. There's a tremendous amount to risk to playing it safe.”

I’m successful in my career and have established a comfortable life. I have friends who love me. I could make a long list of the things I am grateful for. But still my life feels full of nothingness. And the nothingness is suffocating me. 

A couple months ago on a Sunday I spent the whole day crying because the thought of starting another week of my miserable life was unbearable. I outlined three options for myself. Option #1 Run away. But my anxiety wouldn’t allow this. Where would I go? what would I do? What would become if the life I leave behind? Option #2 Kill yourself. But my conscience wouldn’t allow that. I couldn’t put that pain on everyone else. Option #3 Go to a hospital to get help to figure these dark feelings out. But my ego wouldn’t allow that. I couldn’t stand the thought of explaining that to people, admitting things to people that I can hardly admit to myself. So instead I just went to bed and the next day I started the next week in my miserable life. And I’m still going that. And I still haven’t figured out how to escape the nothingness. I’m still suffocating.",1628218804.0,1
“Getting better”,4,oz26ea,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz26ea/getting_better/,0,"I hate how, at the end of the day, the onus falls on you to not be depressed/anxious/so on. Yoga, breathing exercises, meditation etc are considered to be some of the most effective mental health ‘treatments’ out there, but what if they just don’t work for a particular person? It’s so frustrating how people insinuate you are not trying hard enough and, especially if you’re suffering a long bout of depression, that you must ENJOY wallowing in misery. I suppose it all has an element of truth, but that doesn’t help erase the feelings of weakness and ineptitude. I just can’t pull myself up by the bootstraps and snap myself out of it. Sometimes your illness is more powerful than any amount of willpower, and that is okay. Let yourself feel it. We would excuse it for any other illness, so why shouldn’t it be the same for mental health?",1628236501.0,1

I love my mom but hold so much resentment towards her,54,oynrdd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oynrdd/i_love_my_mom_but_hold_so_much_resentment_towards/,9,"I'm so scared to post this because I'm afraid of coming off like some spoiled brat.

I'm a 28F who has recently been seeking treatment for major depression, anxiety, OCD and a few other symptoms of trauma. 

Throughout most of my childhood, my mother had on-and-off episodes of rage. She would take her anger out on whoever was in her way no matter the cause of her outburst. 

I've grown up learning how to listen for footsteps or a change in voice tone. I can honestly say that my mother is the only one in my family to instill true fear in me. 

She was never physically abusive (at least not that I can remember), but she was always capable of saying hurtful things to my dad, my siblings, and me. 

I grew up watching my mom bully my older sister and allow others (including myself) to bully her as well. Even though I always thought it was in good spirit, I felt terribly for her. She now struggles with depression/anxiety but will always cater to our mom in order to avoid another angry episode. 

I always felt responsible for my mother's emotions, and it's now clear to me that she still has this same control over my father. I don't even want to get into how cruel she can be towards him. 

Despite all this, she is a great mother who was always loving to us. She never made me feel like she wasn't there for me, but at this point in my life I feel like I can't connect with her. If she's in the wrong mood, she will invalidate my personal struggles and throw the ""ungrateful"" card at me. 

I always trusted her and believed she understood me, but I can't believe that anymore.",1628185874.0,1

She posts about loneliness, lack of human connection, overworking herself and hating herself. I want to do something nice for her.

Post Grad Depression is Real - I don’t see things getting better anytime soon,9,oyxpiv,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyxpiv/post_grad_depression_is_real_i_dont_see_things/,2,"hi guys! i'm sorry if this is all over the place, i kinda just wanted to vent and also get any advice to feel better. just want to put a disclaimer before i start: i realize i am very lucky and have a lot to be grateful for. the things im worried about are nothing compared to other peoples problems, i understand that, but that doesn't just negate my feelings of sadness. just been really thinking about myself and life in general. i apologize in advance.

anyways, i basically graduated a year early from college (i was supposed to graduate this year, but graduated last year in 2020). i was depressed all of last year because i couldn't find a job and it was also peak pandemic so that didn't make anything better. i finally found a job in may and thought i would be happy but i'm not. im upset because your young 20s are supposed to be your prime and right now, its feeling the opposite.

theres nothing wrong with my job, im actually really happy with it. i actually feel guilty because i know how hard it is to find a job nowadays. i think the main reason why im so sad is because i've been feeling kind of lonely. in college, i was constantly with friends, either at each others dorms or going out to parties. now im back home, still living with my parents. i have like 2-3 friends who live near me who i see often but most of my college friends live in the city so its a lot harder to meet up. it makes me feel bad seeing everyone hanging out with their friends when i go on insta or snap. i deactivated both so i don't have to see it so i can just focus on my mental health. i guess also looking at my laptop screen for 8 hours during work then going straight to my phone after work has been making me feel sluggish and depressed. i've been taking 30 min walks around my neighborhood before it gets too cold again without bringing my phone which is helping me feel a lot better. i've also been journaling/manifesting what i want in life (job promotion, meeting new people, making new friends, my own apartment, just being happy). i just really hope a year from now, things are different and im happier.

another part of me also feels bad that i'm single. i know 22 is still really young but i've never been in a relationship before or really done anything with a boy. sometimes, it truly makes me question myself and think theres something wrong with me. i'm very shy when it comes to guys and been trying to push myself to open up but i can't even do that cos im having trouble meeting new people. i've always heard that if you truly just live your life, the relationship thing will come when you least expect it. right now, i don't see that happening anytime soon but im holding onto hope.

im just hoping to meet as many new people as i can and hope the love stuff will happen naturally because i'm not into dating apps. i'm not sure where to meet new people/make new friends. my company is having an happy hour and usually i would be too nervous to go to an event alone where i don't really know anyone because we've all been working remote, but im REALLY trying to force myself out of my shell and meet new people/get new experiences. i really hope it goes well.

yeah, im sorry if this is messy but basically i guess my main goal is to meet new people/make new friends/experience new things as much as possible but i'm not sure how to do that. i've been trying to look on the bright side such as ill be able to save a lot of money, truly ""find myself"", etc. i guess ill just fully focus on myself and my goals. i've been just been putting all my efforts into my work so i can get a promotion and then finally move out. hopefully, when i move out, ill be happier and itll give me back that college environment since im hoping to find roommates to get really close with.

yeah i understand this is your typical 22 year old confused dilemma but its been lowkey messing with my head. if you have any tips on how to meet new people/make new friends/be less shy/how to focus on myself, let me know, thanks.",1628217298.0,1

TW suicide: I lost 5 hrs of my life and it changed my entire outlook,5,oz083a,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz083a/tw_suicide_i_lost_5_hrs_of_my_life_and_it_changed/,1,"Last night I snapped. I wasn't even as angry/depressed as I have been. I just decided, you know what, fuck everything I'm gonna die.  We had a little argument but nothing noteworthy. I went to bed crying and stopped in the kitchen to grab a bottle of pills. I was in our room going back and forth between ""this is a stupid idea"" and ""just get it over with"". I finally just swallowed everything in one gulp and rolled over to fall asleep forever. About 11:30pm I started to feel very strange and for some reason opened my phone to text my husband that I was taking myself out of the equation. I started to write some notes to people I love.  That's when I started to regret what I had done. I began to think about all the people who I would hurt by doing this. I thought about the things i had yet to do that I've always wanted to.  I thought about my pets.  I thought about how to reverse it.  

The rest of my memories come in flashes.
The next thing I knew i heard my husband yelling,  ""What did you take!?"" Then someone tapping my leg and yelling my name. I am grabbing someone's hands and I fall. I hear the stretcher being drawn up into the ambulance. Someone tells me they are drawing blood. I hear them say my husband will be coming in. A nurse is yelling at me for something and I remember my legs hurting so badly. When I wake up enough they have me talk to a social worker. I'm immediately uncomfortable that I'm in my pajamas and no bra. I notice the hospital gown is thrown over me and i have no blanket. I wonder why nobody is taking care of me. 

I'm awake now and I realize it is 4:30 in the morning. The last thing I recall is sending the text. I am a little annoyed that nobody is looking after me. I keep thinking, do they even know how many pills I took?? They want to admit me but i convince them not to. We go home and go to bed.

This morning it all seems so surreal. Did that even happen? Why didn't anyone care? Was it a dream? Then I ask my husband what happened and the things he says are what changed my entire perspective.

 He found me unresponsive. He said I was pale and slurring. The paramedics got there and gave me a shot to bring me out and it didnt work. They kept slapping me and yelling my name. They used smelling salts but I kept passing out. They were talking to me about my daughter and I said I didn't care at that moment, anyone who knows me knows she is my world.  That was when they took me to the hospital. I couldn't walk so they had to help my through the tiny hallways to where they could get a stretcher. I couldn't spell my own name. They wouldn't let my husband come with me because he needed to fill out the police report. The cop told him I wouldn't know if he was there or not and he was right.  The hospital wouldn't let him in the room at first either.  Before he even saw me they had drawn blood, given me an IV, hooked me up to monitors for my heart, and done multiple tests. I didn't realize he was in the room until hours later. He said I ripped off all of my monitors and the nurse was yelling at me to keep them on. The thing that haunts me the most is that i cannot remember 5 hrs of my life. Him telling me all of this broke my heart.  I cannot believe that I put him through that.  Knowing he had to watch that makes me sick.  He is forever going to have that image of me in his mind and i cannot take that back.  I cannot get back those hrs i lost.  I'm embarrassed.  I'm ashamed that I thought it would be an easy way out without ever thinking about the consequences of those who would find me. I had instant regret when it was too late to help myself reverse it.  Thankfully it didn't work.  I feel so guilty for the trauma i put those people through.  I know for a fact now that I will NEVER do that again. It isn't worth it.  It isn't easy.  And I'll forever be traumatized by those 5 missing hours. 

TLDR: I tried to kill myself and it didn't work but the 5hrs i am now missing scared me enough that I value my life more than ever.

How to cope with depression in a relationship?,2,oz3bao,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz3bao/how_to_cope_with_depression_in_a_relationship/,0,"Hey,

I've been depressed ever since I hit puberty (\~15 years ago). I had a bad childhood (uncaring parents and I've experienced emotional and physical abuse by them), which I guess is what lead to my depression.

I've always struggled with building friendships and relationships. I've always felt like no one enjoys my company and that I'm the least favorite among the group and in general, I've always felt like a burden to people. 

I've tried taking antidepressants and sleeping pills for anxiety (started with zopiclone and zoloft, didn't really feel better for the short time I've been taking them). Now I've been taking deanxit for about 2 years. 

I felt like I was getting better (with some mild depressive moods), but overall I felt like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

The thing is, I tend to feel even worse when I get in a relationship. So, this is my first relationship ever since I started taking deanxit and oh boy, it is not any different. I always feel like I'm not good enough, that people would be better without me and most importantly, I don't feel happy and satisfied in the relationship. And I don't even know why. I've been dating someone for 3 months, and even though they are too busy with work, they try to make time for me and actually listen to me. They try to make things better and have a good time with me, despite of the fact that they don't really understand what depression is (they try to help me but I can't properly explain what is in my head).  

However, I feel like the more they try, the more unsatisfied I feel. It's like I want more and more and I don't even know what is this that I want so much. I get easily frustrated with my partner and the second they don't pay attention to me, I tend to feel angry with them. I know people show their feelings in different ways and I usually am a pretty grateful person, but for some reason I always crave something and feel incomplete in a relationship. Things are getting even worse since my SO gets irritated with my moods  and thus, my SO started distancing themselves. And in times like these, I need more reassurance, which I don't get and in the end, we get into a fight and now it feels like its end of our relationship since it feels like a never ending circle.

I don't know what's wrong with me honestly.  I am tired of fucking it up and letting valuable people go. Is there anyone else feeling like that? Why is this happening? How can I prevent in the future?",1628242387.0,1

I'm so incredibly tired of everything and everyone,39,oylzdd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oylzdd/im_so_incredibly_tired_of_everything_and_everyone/,2,"Do any of you fellow depression-firsthand-specialists ever get to a point where you stop caring about the problems of those around you. And by this i don't mean in a negative way where you emotionally unload on others and engage in self-centered behaviors. I mean just full on still trying your best to support others but not having the energy to care. I know spouts of irritability is typical for this flavor of mental illness, yet it feels as though the more people around me bring up their problems that a) they either created themselves or b) don't take any of my suggestions for solutions that will help them or c) just straight up keep ranting about but won't do anything to change. It gets tiring listening to people all the time. As an emotional support eldest daughter that was heavily parentified and only found out about it in her teen years, i've realized I overextend myself to others. I grew up forced to become a compulsive caretaker, physically and emotionally caring for my sisters and mom when my mom couldn't because of the various problems in her life. I love my mom and would go to the ends of the earth for her, but i can't deny the part of me that resents her for this. 

More specifically with me overextending myself, I always give 110% to my friends when i'm almost always at 20% mentally. I know i need to take some responsibility in this because i need to strengthen my boundaries, but at the same time even with my friends who have mental illness issues, I don't feel like they understand that i don't have authentic energy to give them right now. It always comes off as me being flakey but really it's just hard for me to talk to people on the phone when physically i feel like i want to go to sleep but can't. Even when depression and anxiety tells me i shouldn't go out for the day, I still go to hang out with me. Even when my social battery is dead, I still go out of my way for them. This isn't to say they don't support me, because I am lucky to have good friends. I'm just realizing I give too much to them and not enough to myself. 

Two sort of friendships made me realize i over extend myself. recently a friend of mine who routinely emotionally dumps on me contacted me and essentially said we don't feel as close as we used to. In all honestly to me them saying that feels a bit dramatic. I'm away right now and not any where near them. I made it clear I wouldn't be back for a while and even told them when i would be so we could hang out. They kept asking when i would be home and have even made passive aggressive comment once about us not hanging out. Every time we do hang out this person emotionally unloads on me and doesn't respect my time often overstaying their welcome when i tried to make it clear before that I had other things i needed to do that day. They also do a lot of manipulative things like try to appeal to my emotions with what they are going through and putting me in and awkward position when i have to tell them no because of the things I'm personally going through. I feel bad for them, because they are genuinely going through some terrible things, but at the same time half of their problems are problems they create themselves by continuing relationships with people they know are toxic, or blatantly acknowledging then ignoring red flags. I don't have a problem with them, I do still care about them, but i'm over their complaining. It's draining. 

My ex-roommate is very similar to this person. They often unloaded on me emotionally, was extremely passive aggressive, and mean whenever something in their life wasn't going their way. I don't remember one time where they've supported me or listened to my issues without turning it back to their problems. Most of these problems involve their past and ptsd experiences, which as someone who suffers from deep childhood trauma, i understand how things can trigger and set you off. However, I quickly grew tired of them going on and on about their past and how terrible people were to them when they were in the present being an asshole to me. I was too understanding and i'm still trying to forgive myself for that. I too often vented about this person but rarely confronted them about their actions. I didn't want to make things worse for them. I knew they were like this when i first met them and as a result distanced myself and took to be their acquaintance. It was harder to avoid their shitty tendencies when we became roommates. Tbh i've never met anyone so entitled and so incapable of handling emotions. They are very emotionally immature. I believe this is a result of their parents stepping in to take care of them every time the slightest thing goes wrong. They put up a façade of wanting to be independent and complain about their parents, yet aren't doing the work to be so. In fact, I'm convinced they only started being independent because their parents disprove of them living with their significant other and threatened to no longer support them financially. apart of me feels bad for disliking this person as much as I do (the people pleasing part), the human me who doesn't strive to be perfect and kind all the time acknowledges that some people suck and that person lowkey is one of them. 

In both situations i distanced myself, of course having decent interactions with both of them every once in a while, but realizing they both drain my emotional energy, i put up a wall to not deal with them. I don't hate my ex- roommate, I could get along with them in a group setting where i don't actually have to talk to them. At the end of the day I know how my friends are and it isn't them. 

I have a childhood friend that i haven't seen in about a year due to the pandemic. We still keep in contact here and there. But i miss them so much. Apart of me feels as though college and the pandemic have made us drift apart. It makes me so sad. Especially when i've realized most of the time they come to me only when they need help on papers. My other friend rarely talks to me anymore, she has a boyfriend now and from what i've heard spends most of her time with her. I love them dearly, but i'm scared that i don't have a place in their life anymore. I'm scared they won't have me in their big life moments because its been so long. 

I'm at a period in my life where everything feels so hard. I have a damn good life, because of what my mom instilled in me growing up and a combination of my resilience and hard work. I am where i want to be in life situationally, but not mentally. I feel so tired, so unheard, so broken. I have no hope right now. I reach out to my god and religion often, praying and trying my best to work on myself but I'm so tired. It's hard for me to feel motivated nowadays. Its hard for me to care about others problems. I'm tired of caring about others problems. 

How do I start actively putting myself first and working on myself? Is it okay to distance myself from others for a while in order to get my shit together? How do I genuinely stop going out of my way for people and start doing those things for myself?",1628180805.0,1

It's really crazy to me in a way that some people truly do for whatever reason get so into a dark place they are just trying to make others hurt, all they want is to make others feel pain as it's just become so dark in their reality ... and it's something I feel bad for as you have to be in such a dark place to be trying to intentionally hurt a complete stranger. I truly believe in what Yoda said:

**Fear is the path to the dark side**. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

This is so true, man Yoda is wise:

*A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.*

*In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.*

*To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not.*

That was really depressing and I feel really tired, like it's exhausting being around people who are that unhealthy they are trying to hurt others intentionally. I'll be OK. Just listen to music and watch my documentary about deers but ... yeah, that was difficult.

I certainly developed greater compassion for how tiring it must be to be around people like that a lot. Thankfully I don't know too many people stuck in that mode but so much compassion for what people have to absorb and live with, how much those experiences would change people towards the dark.

How do you manage when you have absolutely no energy?,45,oyhxil,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyhxil/how_do_you_manage_when_you_have_absolutely_no/,17,"Hello,

I'm not sure where to begin but I figured this would be an ok place. I have been dealing with quite a bit and you are welcome to read my previous comment I made in another thread that goes into detail.

While I am figuring things out, I'd like to ask how you all cope with depression as I lose motivation EA h day that passes. I dread waking up, the drive to work, talking to people. My energy and will to do things are nonexistent as I don't even enjoy doing what I like doing. My free time is spent playing games and reading as that is how I like to unwind but I have not been in the mood to do either of those things.

I would like to make it clear that I do NOT* have any intentions of hurting myself and I am still coming to terms with depression and PTSD. I force myself to manage the day but it is extremely tiring to the point where I don't do much on my time off. The most I do is laundry to make sure I have clothes for the week. I have been eating once a day which I understand is not healthy but I have no appetite and do not want to force something I may not hold down.

It seems I am doing the minimum to keep doing and realize that I cannot do that for long or it may get worse. I am stressed, depressed, anxious and reaching out for help while I am still somewhat rational as it is hard. 

I take B12 as I have a vitamin deficiency though it doesn't seem like it helps. I do also take some heart medicine as the VA still hasn't figured out those issues. While I am not in a relationship, I am seeing someone though I am not sure how long that will last either as my sexual drive has been nonsexist for a while as I know stress and anxiety can effect it. I have been talking to my doctor and it seems I am showing signs of ED though so there is more to add to my plate.

Regardless of it all, I am reaching out to get your input to better myself and thank you for any information.

How do people be happy?,1,oz3ad7,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz3ad7/how_do_people_be_happy/,1,"Seriously. How? 

I have struggled with rapid cycling bipolar 1 (among other disorders) for years and I'm just so tired. Like exhausted. Nothing feels fun anymore. I can't find enjoyment in anything that I used to. This happens all the time but this time feels different. I don't know..this time is way harder. It's like I feel doomed. I can't sleep because I lay in bed with paranoid panic about everything I might have done wrong to ruin my future life. I can't afford health insurance to get back to treatment/therapy (which I need and miss very much). 

I have been struggling for so long with no one to talk to that I put in years of being the ""good advice friend""..helping others through hard times in hopes that any of them would come to care about me enough to be there for me too. Instead I became to person people only come to when they need help. They dump their feelings and problems onto me to use me for advice, then disappear once they feel better. If I mentioned a was struggling there was AT BEST maybe a ""that sucks, I'm sorry"" but usually radio silence. If I didn't message first I didn't hear from them unless they needed something...and eventually I just stopped responding. I've come to realize I really truly have no friends.

The only people I have left are my family and my partner. I love my family so much but I can't talk to them because I'm not comfortable with it. I don't want to seem like I'm after attention.. the problem I that with no one to talk to, I end up boiling over and having extreme meltdowns at home. Leaving my partner being the only one who knows how bad I am truly struggling. How bad I am really doing. The littlest inconvenience or problem and I explode into these uncontrollable angry/upset crying episodes in which I vent every single thing that I'm upset about and I'm nearly inconsolable. The problem is, with my bipolar episodes, it's like an out of body experience. Like I'm floating above this out of control version of myself and I know I need to calm down. I know I am out of control and I need to breathe, but I can't do anything about it. I fear I'm ruining their life by being in it. Sometimes I think about how much easier it would be for everyone if I were gone. That their lives would be better. I know that's wrong in a sense though. I know it would hurt them if I killed myself. I know they would struggle and I dont want the for them. But I'm so tired. I'm tired of being sad. 

I'm tired of everything. 

Sometimes I think about how hard life is with mental illness and I can't imagine what it would be like to be someone who is just mentally healthy.

I want to have fun and be happy. I just don't know how anymore. It feels so out of reach.

I long for the intimacy. I long for our first form of communication. Safety, Security, Comfort all in the gentle caress of a finger or the brush of lips on the soft cheeks. We need that touch from the one we love, almost as much as we need air to breathe. But I never understood the importance of touch. Her touch. Please help me.

I feel like there is something rotten inside of me. I find it near impossible to drown out the constant cacophony of voices whispering in my ear, telling me I don't deserve love. I want someone to make the effort and be there for me and care about me the way I care for them and make the effort to be there for them, but at the same time, I want everyone to abandon me so I can disappear without feeling guilty & causing pain.

Eating healthy or at least trying to doesn't work. I can't talk to my parents about mental health issues because they obviously just, can't. (Read previous posts for my context)  

I try letting my friends in, and end up pushing away everyone and the one person I had to talk to about this stuff even got sick of me and has barely talked to me for 2 months. I've tried making new ones but I'm so depressing and emotionless and hard to be around that I can't even do that well. People get so sick of me that they don't want to be around me anymore. Combine that with the crippling anxiety. Not social anxiety but just general anxiety over the dumbest things.

Therapy is too expensive, probably even for my parents. I don't want to be pills or anti depressants. These stupid hotlines, and ""crisis text lines"" are all scams and automated messages from reviews I've been reading and will in fact call the police on you.

Recently I've tried to find hotlines and text lines and even then these hotlines and text lines are about as useful as a school counselor, whose honestly only purpose is to ""get you back on the right track so they can talk to you more about college"" Trust me I've tried starting some conversation with them. 

So what do I even do? I'm dying on the inside and outside. Sleep schedule fucked, I'm underweight and barely can get myself to even eat the 2 meals a day I do have. All I do is pointlessly edit shit for my small ass youtube channel which is the only thing that probably keeps me sane when I'm barely even allowed outside, I'm allowed to sleep for most of the entire day though without anyone stopping me or waking me up, I have no responsibilities, no actual life skills or any sort of reasonable or useful skill. And all I do is masturbate 4 times a day for 2 hours just to have something to do.

About 5 months ago i threw a party the day covid limits were lifted there was a girl there with whom i was friends with that slept at my house after the party ended, everything right for the night and the morning after i asked her if she wanted to fuck and she accepted.

One week later some friends of both asked me what happened and when i told them what whappened told me that she was accusing me of raping her, i was fucking devastastated by that but at least i was Happy that my Friends has asked me what happened and seemed to believe me

One month afterwards all the friends that had told me that were saying that i had raped her, two months after and not only that but she also proceded to report me to the police for rape, three months from that and not only the Friends we have in common but also my Friends from college stoped talking to me

One month ago i finally had a good new because the case was dropped because she failed to present any proof of the acusation and i presented an audio where she did recognise that she had consented to fuck with me
I thought that the case being dropped would finally end with all of this and for a time It was but today the last friend from college Who already new all that happened has stopped talking to me 

She hasnt answered any of my messages for more tjam a week and she has thrown me out from her followers on insta, i know it might not seem like much but i know the meaning of this kind of acts

I've spent far too much time thinking, and it seems to get me nowhere. As Jean-Paul Sartre put it 'My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think… and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it's frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing'. 

In fact, nothing seems to feel ""real"". So what if it's not? Well, it wouldn't make a difference. We have to live the lives we live. And that's not exactly something that motivates me. What is there to live for? If I could, it would be nice (?) to live without a purpose and dwell at my own bidding. However, (unfortunately) society happens to be fairly difficult to escape from.

Logically, the best way out here is suicide. But then again, to quote Albert Camus: 'It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end'.

My unhealthy reliance on weed for an emotional uplift,1,oz0618,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz0618/my_unhealthy_reliance_on_weed_for_an_emotional/,0,"Basically since the pandemic started I've been smoking at least 3 days a week. That number has been constant all throughout the past year and is what I am at now. There has been some periods of time where I would get high for around 5 - 10+ hours a day, everyday--and the worst of it was when I did it for 3 weeks straight. At first I did it out of sheer curiousity for the drug, but now I've experienced all that and it ends up being my go-to as a fix for whenever I am depressed, lonely, or feeling empty. 

I've really fucked myself here, I recognize it as a problem but I've relied on it for so long for that emotional boost/remedy that going without it for 3 days (usually) leaves me in a state of depression, devoid of emotion or interest in anything--and at worst, very intense self deprecation which makes me contemplate suicide. I've tried to quit plenty of times but I just cant seem to overcome this hurdle. 

Also do you know those random moments of feeling empty that you get in social gatherings, events, etc. ? I've been getting those since I was 12, about 8 years ago. I've gotten them probably over a hundred times now and I can definitely say that at the start they were due to feelings of lonelyness and not feeling a sense of belonging anywhere, but now I cant even tell. It'd start off randomly, clearing my head of any thoughts, which will then lead me to stress about my problems (i stress SUPER easily especially about anything long term). I just get in my head and pick apart anything I dont like about myself or anything around me. I'd get an intense feeling of anger, self-hate, lonelyness, shame, sadness, or emptyness depending on what I am venting about in my thoughts. But recently it keeps routing back to self-hate where I'd end up seriously bullying myself for my actions and thoughts because deep down I truly feel like a sack of shit unwelcome anywhere I'd go.

Any time I am even remotely close to a slow progression to quitting weed I'd get this 'random moment,' completely fucking up my momentum. Literally anything could trigger it now; a random fight with a friend, a pet peeve being triggered, anxiety and overthinking about myself, etc. With classes propping up again a month from now, I cant even imagine what a fucking mess I'd be if I cant even handle the summer with the least interactions with anything.

Right now I am on my 4th day of not smoking. It is really tough on me right now. 4 days ago I started to get stressed on just my own personal problems, with repeated headaches that I still have right now. The 4th day kinda sounds like an achievement considering 3 days is usually my limit but this is only due to me working a summer job which leaves me less time to smoke. Another reason that I've made it this far is thay I cant even sleep for more than 2 hours at a time--I've only gotten 9 hours total since sunday night. I honestly dont know how I am still functioning but I do drink multiple coffees a day and it feels like I am on the brink of collapsing soon. I'm writing this right now unable to sleep, with me needing to leave for work in a couple of hours without feeling a single thing so I am sorry that this whole thing looks messy. I know I glossed over some topics without specific details. Heck I dont even know if I am posting this just to rant or share my experience or ask for advice.

None of my friends know that this is how badly depressed I am feeling inside. I sometimes let it leak out with sarcastic cries for help hoping that one of my friends will notice but thats as selfish I'd go with this. I dont want to shoulder my emotional baggage onto someone but fuck it sucks to feel this way inside.

All I know is that everything is fucked right now.",1628226908.0,1
I am angry all the time now,1,oz054n,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oz054n/i_am_angry_all_the_time_now/,0,"The title pretty much says it all.
 
I think I need to get off social media, Reddit included, it’s not really helping things. 

Been depressed for a while but not yet in a financial situation where I can address it adequately from a medicinal and therapeutic perspective.

Just really angry at the world and the society that we live in. It feels like the only way to win is to essentially become a narcissist or psychopath with no regard for others. 

You either become a willing participant in the game of oppression and learn to take joy in the oppression and suffering of others, or you become a cruel but ignorant slave to the game not realizing how much you’re also being oppressed while stepping on the toes of those who happen to still be below you, or you keep your empathy and refuse to participate but ultimately suffer in a world that wasn’t designed for you to have feelings or goodwill toward others. 

For a long time it made me wish I was dead. Because I do feel empathy and the thought that so many, like me, are just constantly suffering hurts too much. 

Then things got slightly better in my life. Found a person I actively love and love me back. Reconnected with some family and have a better support system for the most part. I don’t personally want to die, at least right now.

But now I just feel more angry. 
Day in and day out of seeing so many people just constantly suffer while the rest actively create, or passively allow, the suffering.

Those people make me so angry. They make me wish, for a moment at least, that *they* were dead. That we could just take every narcissist and psychopath that actively keeps making this world a worse place and just wipe them off the face of the earth forever. That *I* could personally wipe them off the face of the earth. 

But that’s wrong. And dark. And ultimately reductive and childish because I understand there really isn’t a way to stop people from being this way in the first place even if they were somehow magically erased. So evil would still persist regardless. 

I don’t actually want to hurt people. I dislike violence. I dislike the thought of pain for myself or for others. 

I’m just having a hard time grappling with the idea that there is now a part of me that is actively, and more consistently, wishing harm on other people, even if it is in unrealistic and fantastical fashion.

I’m just really angry all the time and it frightens me what that anger can make me think, especially when I know the thoughts are wrong and they make me ultimately feel worse about myself and what kind of person that means I am.

I tired of being angry and sad. I just want to be happy again. 

I do feel better writing this all out somehow. 

Thanks to anyone who reads it even if they don’t reply. Guess I just want to throw it out there so if anyone has ever felt similarly they won’t feel so alone.

I projected my anger on my older sister who now probably is reminded why she hates herself. After I ruined her day, I went upstairs and wanted to cut myself but I restrained it. And so, it’s why I don’t mind her telling me that I should kill myself. Because honestly, I should.

So like why the fuck am I not doing it yet? I’m really worthless. Anyone online or physically or whatever could tell me I’m not but that will never get in my head because I know that I’m not. And I’m so stubborn. Unless you hit me with a rock, maybe I’ll listen then. 

Nothing works anymore. Why can’t I just accept the fact that maybe I even have tiny bit of worth? Why can’t I not? 

Maybe it’s just that I’m that much of a sucky person that I failed myself. I think everyone tried too hard to make me kind but I ended up turning out to be the person who I hate most.

I tell myself that half of why I’m like this is because of my dad. But it’s not, isn’t it? Yes, he kept saying I wasn’t a good person. Yes, he hit me whenever I didn’t listen. Yes, he cursed at me and called me stupid over and over again. But that was years ago, I’m a teen now. I’m not supposed to use that excuse anymore, right?

I don't feel like I am anywhere. I'm just floating about, completely senseless, in a void. My senses technically work, I can see (although I have the usual derealization visual snow and stuff), I have ears, I have skin. But they don't feel like they work like they should. I can't feel a hug for what a hug is meant to be, you might as well hug a fridge. I could smell something and tell you what it is, but I can't appreciate it. I can look at something but I can't say for certain that it's even there in front of me or that I'm even looking at it, if it were a figment of my imagination I would have the same confidence in it. It's so hard to explain. It's like a dream. In fact no, my dreams feel more real.

If I can't feel anything like I'm in a sensory deprivation tank, then how do I know that this isn't just how reality is? Because I have a few memories that I cling on to. For example I sort of remember what's its like to breathe the winter air. Or walk in a big city. But I also feel like I've been numb for as long as I can remember. I want it to end, I want to feel human again and live life as I'm supposed to experience it.

I don't know why where ever I go feels so wrong. Why each place I go feels like I'm in the wrong timeline or someone else's life. Almost all relationships feel fake, or maybe I just have bad friends. It always (for years) feels like I'm supposed to be somewhere else, but I don't know where, and I don't know why. And I worry the second I go somewhere new the feelings will chase me. I hate my home, but I don't know why. It's a nice place, it's pretty, people are (mostly) nice but it's like the second someone sees me I feel them thinking ""she doesn't belong here"" and I don't want to either. Alarm bells in my head won't stop ringing about how everything is wrong.

I feel like a ticking time bomb, I don't see an end to this hell and when I'm reminded of that it's when the darkest thoughts  and feelings take over. When I try mindfulness and ""being present"" it seems to have the opposite effect and I sink back into myself, into the void further.

So yea I guess I’m alone now,1,oyzzwh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyzzwh/so_yea_i_guess_im_alone_now/,1,"
Today was the straw that broke the camels back……
So I don’t know if it sounds “needy” of me but at this point I don’t give two craps.
I felt like my best friend for 5 years that I could tell anything to would always be by my side.
But stuff happened, he got into drugs like weed and crap…..to “self medicate” 
Me I’ve never done anything, I get sick to the bone when I see or hear drugs, I’ve had two family members die due to drug issues….so I’m pretty hesitant to stay far away from them.
So as he started to do more he started to become a crappy friend, would listen but not care.
Would thankfully accept the gifts but not give me the light of day to talk to me when I had a gun to my head because he was “tired”
But recently he got caught smoking weed while I was over at his house (mind you I’m 16 so we obviously still live at our parents)
But his mum got mad blamed me and kicked me out.
(She only blames me because I live in a poor neighborhood no joke)
So over summer brake I’ve tried many times to try and hang out….he gave an excuse “oh my mom won’t let anyone over” 
But then came July…my one year anniversary of being admitted to a mental hospital….asked him a week before if I could come over on my anniversary, he said sure..
So the week of it I asked…he said we was at another friends house.
(This friend is the one that’s selling him drugs, he was doing drugs at his house that’s the only reason why I couldn’t come over)

Same thing today, asked if he wanted to come over and he told me that he doesn’t know if his mom would let him….didn’t even try to ask.
So I feel like he doesn’t give two shits about me, I feel like all he cares about is just doing weed.
And the bad thing is that he’s pretty much my whole reason of living…but now I feel like this friendship won’t last very long…and we’ll he’s literally the only friend I have…

I’m tired of his mom always blaming me when his drug test comes back positive.
I just want to tell her “then test me, it’s gonna come back negative, but test his friend and it’s gonna come back positive because that’s where he gets the drugs, so don’t judge people for what you can’t see.
Because just because I’m poorer then dirt doesn’t mean I’m a drug dealer”
But idk I don’t wanna make things worse.

Not like these days where it's more recognized and not as stigmatized.

I guess I never really grasped how depressed I was til everything because extraordinarily exhausting, just responding to a text is an effort I don't have the energy for and every day is a the same. Days off sometimes even when I wake up early I will lie in bed til I am forced to get up and carry out a semblance of a day. It's not one off either, it's every day off. My work causes me so much stress and anxiety that it's almost choking at times. Nothing is really bad it's everything is bad, it's just everything is exhausting and if it's not exhausting it's annoying. 

Anyways I am not looking for help. It just feels nice to vent anyoumously. It just feels like a long time I felt excited for anything. But it's not I am on crying jags, it's just an emptiness.

Unironically considering dropping out of college,1,oyznre,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyznre/unironically_considering_dropping_out_of_college/,1,"I had my first year of college last year, and I think it's safe to say most people thought it sucked. However, and I know this sounds dramatic, but something just broke me last year. I had a plan going into college, maybe not a solid one, but it was something. I wanted to socialize, study, just have a new experience. But after last year, having to suffer through a shitty online class system, and seeing my mental health just drop, I've done a little thinking.

I don't really have any passions in life. There's not really a lot of things I would consider myself passionate about, and even less so that I can turn into something I could monetize. The only thing I can think of is art and illustrating, but honestly, I actually don't really know if I want that to be my career. Yeah, if I can grow popular online and do commissions as a side gig, I'd love that, but I really don't wanna risk tainting one of the few things I still love to do by going into  the industry and turning that into a career. I'll be honest. I actually think I would be much happier just doing a regular 9-5 job than going into a major industry like medicine or something. I don't really want to be rich or famous. I just want enough to be content in life. My own home, bunch of video games and other nerd shit that I'd kill to have, and idk, a cat or something. I just don't really know if I wanna go through the entire process, only to end up with just a paper in a thing I don't want and a bunch of money in debt.

Obviously this is a huge decision, and I haven't made my final choice yet. Honestly, I'm terrified to even bring this up with my parents cause I feel like this will just make them even more mad and disappointed. I'll bring this up with my therapist next time, and maybe at least try to explain myself to my parents.

I need an outside perspective. Is my home life hindering me from getting handle of my depression?,1,oyzl7a,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyzl7a/i_need_an_outside_perspective_is_my_home_life/,0,"I’ve been struggle with anxiety and depression for a long time, since before my husband and I started dating. It’s gotten significantly worse over the last 8 years, more so in the last couple of years. I’ve been working with my doctor to find a medication that will work, I’m going in between therapists. It’s debilitating. Every day is very difficult and this is the lowest I’ve been. One thing that has been crossing my mind a lot lately is wondering if my marriage is something that might be hindering my mood. We’ve been married for 8 years and together for 13. We have what I think are normal marital struggles that all couples deal with at some point. There are certain things that my husband does that really trigger my anxiety and depression and can cause me to crumple inside. I know my reaction isn’t his fault and it’s on me to manage my mood. They are things that we have talked about but we never seem to be able to change them. 

I’ve realized that stress really effects me. I can deal with my work stress but not with my personal stress. I used to think that my husband and I shared the domestic workload pretty evenly but it doesn’t feel like it. My husband will tidy the kitchen or family room when it gets out of hand but I’m realizing that if the house gets out of hand it’s because I’m not keeping up with it. The same goes for meal planning, grocery shopping, finances, caring for our child.  He’s a very attentive and loving father but he doesn’t make sure our daughter brushes and flosses, bathes, brushes her hair, go to bed on time each day - if I don’t do it then it often won’t get done. The thing is if I’m doing poorly and am in a depressed mood I’m not able to always get these things done for my daughter. Then knowing how frustrating it is for my husband makes my chest feel unbearably heavy.  Over the years it’s like these things have become solely my responsibility and hearing his frustration (lots of sighing and huffing and puffing when he cleans or gets our daughter to do something) now makes me crumple up inside and shut down. I hear it and it’s like a switch flips and I want to shut down. We’ve talked about this a couple times. How I feel like everything is weighing on me and he’ll reassure me that he doesn’t expect me to do it all… but nothing changes, if I don’t do it then it doesn’t get done and my husband is annoyed by the mess and it’s a never ending cycle. When I’m in a depressed state I have to do things in small bursts. I’ve learned that I have to stop when I feel mentally exhausted and take breaks. But the pressure that I feel (and I don’t know if it’s actually there) from my husband makes this impossible. When he’s out for the evening things feel calm and I’m able to tackle the things that need to be done but when he’s home I feel like I’m in survival mode.  Even delegating all the tasks feels like to much at this point.  

These things weigh on me so much. They eat at me every day. I keep feeling like I need to escape and that if I just had some space that my mind could rest and I could get a handle of things. 

There are other more personal marital problems that weigh on me as well and that cause the same kind of stress.

I can't stop blaming myself because I know I could do better, and I just feel really stupid and worthless.

I hate isolation and online school because I just feel lonely all the time, and I don't really have any friends I can talk to. I got a scholarship for a good college because I had strong grades in highschool, but now I'm at significant risk to lose it due to my grades dropping since I have to keep above a certain gpa to maintain it. I haven't told my parents yet in hopes that my final grades this semester will be enough to raise it, but I'm terrified about telling them because I know they'll be furious.

Question about processing emotions,5,oypl5s,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oypl5s/question_about_processing_emotions/,2,"Hey everyone!

First of all I want to say that I am really proud of everyone who is strong enough to share personal emotions, moments of weakness etc. online, with friends&family etc.

I've been living with depression for most of my life because I've been through a lot and it took me a long time to admit that seeking help from a professional is the way to go or at least wouldn't hurt.

As you can probably tell from the overall tone of my post I managed to develop/foster techniques that help me restore some balance. That being said, and I guess a lot of people will feel the same, negativity sometimes comes back out of nowhere and drags me down into a black-hole and digging my way out of it sometimes takes more and sometimes less time. It feels like I am still falling into that hole but the shovel I am using to get out of it is of higher quality and more effective than it used to be.

The reason I am writing this post is curiosity and hope for some opinions on a certain technique I've been using to manage with stressful situations or nagging thoughts.

I often heard that writing about your negative thoughts, about situations that evoke those feelings, just about whatever, helps us to tackle the problems much more than thinking about them.

My question is, and I know it's a rather small difference but here me out, whether or not it's better to write things down on my computer/digital or with an actual pen..

Writing about my emotions/feelings in general feels rather productive but I really tend to write about them on my computer because of my rather fast typing speed, which makes it feel more time efficient I assume. It feels like I am answering my question to a degree while asking the question but do you think or did you experience a difference between using pen&paper ""vs"" keyboard in that regard?

If you wrote about your feelings before and felt benefits from it I would be glad to hear about your thoughts and if you never considered writing about them with pen&paper it would also be interesting to hear the reasons behind that.

I didn't give too many specifics about my ""background"" and what makes me struggle with depression but since I am in a rather good emotional spot right now I didn't really feel the need to do that. 

If you actually read all the way through, and even if you just jumped to the last sentence, I hope you had a wonderful day and I wish you all the best because you and everyone else deserves it :).",1628191055.0,1

I wouldn't say we were close, but I definitely loved them, and I've known them all my life. During their illness, I wanted to call, or text or something, but I just didn't know what to say. Then it got to the point where it wouldn't have mattered what I said. They were breathing, but the person was gone. Maybe I should have still said something anyway. I think about it, and I just don't feel regret. I'm sad about it, but not distraught. It's been expected for some time now.

I lost my dad earlier this year, somewhat suddenly. I don't think I've copied with that. I don't even think I've copied with losing my mom 20 years ago. I was in a time of personal change and there was excitement and stress and anxiety. The same can be said about when I lost my dad. I had other things going on. When I get saddest is when I think of all the time I lost during COVID. We were so excited about seeing each other again. I miss him. I miss my mom. I miss my family friend.

Why then, does my sadness manifest itself in such a weird fucking way? Why do I not cry when I think of these people, but cry when I watch a television show, and then cry some more when flashes of scenes from the show pop into my brain later? Even when it's not a sad episode from Community. Is it just the fictional relationships making me wish I wasn't so alone right now? Is it the stress of having to pack for travelling to attend the funeral, find out my suit no longer fits (I'm considerably more of a fat ass these days) and then the release of that stress later when I'm able to find clothes that fit? Is it the continued stress of having to travel and make it to the funeral, and feeling like I won't look my best (even though I know it won't matter)?

I know how Community ends (I've watched it several times), so am I sad when I think of the show simply because it reminds me of the passage of time, and friends being inseparable, yet they still have to move on with their lives? It reminds me that I'm in a state of arrested development and flux, and being reminded of the passage of time reminds me that I'm losing more and more people from my life, and gaining now new ones.

Looking for a way to help my wife break free from chronic depression,1,oyxt7p,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyxt7p/looking_for_a_way_to_help_my_wife_break_free_from/,0,"Hi, my wife has chronic depression. It's insidious because she functions with it, but it robs her of agency, career direction, friends, and everyday joy. She says she ""feels dead"". She's been like this for 20 years, and it's gotten worse lately, with the pressures of parenting and covid. She has been in psychotherapy for that time, going from one therapist to another, not healing much. The main reason for this is that she feels dull, and is unable to get in touch with her pain, to say ""this hurts! help me!"" So, she tells me that these therapy sessions are pretty superficial, e.g. the discussion is around 'I don't like this person at work', my wife leaves feeling a little better, but never gets to the real issue. She just decided to stop seeing her therapist. This therapist told her 'you don't like yourself'. When my wife asked the therapist how she could fix that, she apparently had no answer. I am in therapy and I get a lot out of it, but unfortunately my wife does not. It pains me to see her so stuck, so inert. I have told her that the first step to getting help is to write down what she specifically wants to get out of the therapy. Nonetheless, she says that she doesn't feel much pain around not liking herself, so I'm worried that if she finds a new therapist that the same superficial thing will happen. She has thought about microdosing as a way to get out of the depression. I suggested CBT, and maybe some spiritual practice. I know that ultimately she has to take the initiative. The problem is that she hasn't. What, if anything, can I do to help my wife get better, to snap out of the dull trance of depression? Thanks.",1628217678.0,1

You can see my previous posts. Before I was suicidal. I self harmed a lot. I was unhappy and didn’t feel secure in the friendships I had. 

Now we are 8months into the year and I’m doing really well. Self harming less, I’ve been productive with my time, I have better relationships with everyone around me, I’m taking my medication properly and I’m back in therapy. I’m not going to pretend it’s been plain sailing. I’ve slipped up a few times. I have days where everything is too much and I can’t concentrate and feel overwhelmed. But those days are few and far between, and they seem more manageable now. I’m finally learning to look after myself and set appropriate boundaries, while also now being able to be there for my friends too because I’m in a better place.

I’ve had issues with my mental health for ten years. It’s difficult. And maybe I started getting better for the wrong reasons. But it’s turned into me realising I’m the only person that’s 100% there for me. Other people encourage and support, and that really helps. But it’s only you that will save you.

I'm 20 years old, 21 in a few weeks. My life has changed a lot this year and I thought it would be good. But with every day that passes, I feel more and more tired and unmotivated.

I lived in a very toxic household for years. My step father and I never had a good relationship but it kept declining over the years, to the point of pointless arguments with my mother about small stuff. I was working on a restaurant with a horrible boss that made me feel like shit everyday.

Slowly things started to change. I got out my house and live alone now and changed jobs to a better one. But still, I feel stuck somehow.I blamed my unhappiness on my previous situations but changing then didn't help anything.

I have a small group of friends but still feel very lonely. I can't see a couple walking in the street without feeling bad about myself.

In the past week or so, I just cry myself to sleep. I played a lot of video games to distract myself but now I can't play for more than 30 minutes before feeling exhausted and bored. I force myself to do it only to not think about my current mental situation.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know we are in charge of our own happiness but I just can't stop feeling like I need someone to show me I'm worthed.

Life in general is becoming such a burden that my fear of death is no longer a valid excuse to not think about ending it...

My mom had an abusive alcoholic/meth addict boyfriend, and my brother was a heroine addict and I'm pretty sure my mom was back on meth for a while too during all the bullshit. This was going on a lot back when i was still in high school, there was constant fighting going on and i ended up hardly going to school cause i was always worried about what was gonna happen at home. It got so bad to the point where one day one of my teachers even flat out asked me what's going on at my home. But i grew up with my shitty family (mostly my brother) always telling me ""snitches get stiches"" so i kept my mouth shut. And i was already 18 anyways so not like the school could've done anything either way since i was considered an adult. But between school and constant drama at home i was stressed and i ended up dropping out just cause i couldn't focus on my school work. Flash forward a couple years later after i dropped out things kept going on and i ended up finding out my dad was dying. My mom and i finally got her shitty boyfriend out of our lives and she was finally getting her head out of her ass but we were still dealing with my brother. He was still causing drama and it was so bad to the point where we could hardly leave our apartment cause he was basically trying to turn it into a drug house. He already caused us to lose one home and i wasn't about to let him cause us to be homeless again. I really wanted to visit my dad more cause me and him hardly got to spend any time together cause his wife kept moving them further and further away from us and we didn't have a lot of money either for gas and she knew this too. But i didn't wanna leave our home cause i was more worried about what my shitty brother would've done to the place and all his druggy friends.

Hell all the friends I've made thus far of backstabbed me. I met some new people recently but they live a ways away and and most of them are a couple years or more younger then me so I don't think I can make it work. Above all my biggest coping mechanism and favorite hobby video games has been striped away from me away from me by toxic fans I went in more detail on a post I  made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/m6j1rp/gamers_are_the_reason_im_depressed/). But basically I used to love the fallout series but a bunch of fanboys sucked out my joy for it. They kept hammering in my head how there opinions where superior to mine and smearing or braiding people who disagreed. I actually had an experience recently at a summer camp where someone said I had terrible taste in character and in games after voicing my opinions on the fallout series. That's actually one of the things that tipped me over the edge and made me this suicidal. Because of this toxicity and fanboyish behavior the excitement and enthusiasm I once had for games has vanished It's sad. I've said this before but I only got a chance top play four mature games on my own. I'll never get to indulge myself in the worlds of The Witcher, Bioshock, Mass-effect, The Last of Us, Half-life, many many more. I actually wanted to play the Battle for the Bikini Bottom remastered. largely because it was my dream as a kid to play it but I couldn't because it was on the game cube or something. But now I just can't these ass-wholes towaway my childhood dream. Why dose god allow this to his children. Why. Is he even real or is he just evil. I'm one of the lucky ones right now there are kids starving and here I am complaining about my trivial ass problems. I know none of you will understand my pain. You'll all laugh at me or ignore me, I understand. I'm not looking for your sympathy. I Just want people to know what I feel. I'll probably post this on another subreddit just to ensure more people see it. But I know no one will. It will get deleted of be viewed  by only a couple dozen people.

I don't know if any of you will take me seriously or understand where I'm coming from. But that's fine. Anyway if you've read this far down, thanks. Like I said I really don't care what Yawl  think of me. I'm just glad somebody's listening. I feel so alone in the fact that nobody really knows how I feel of listening to my problems.

Living on disability getting 800 a month to live on and in debt where 200 of my check goes to paying back the government from where they said they overpaid me on my disability check I owe them 9k, for the next 4 years. I have 3 credit cards I had to take out and use to get dental work and other things done medically that insurance wouldn't cover. 

I have no extra income. there are days I can barely get out of bed because of how badly my body hurts because of the weight and the arthritis I have in my lower back, knees, feet and ankles. 

most of my family are dead, my mom died when I was 25, my real dad when I was 23. I spent 10 yrs being homeless doing day labor for food or a bed to sleep in that night. 

I bought a car 4 years ago that took me 5 yrs to save 2k. got scammed by the dealership. still can't save any money to try to buy another vehicle to live in.

Bought a gaming laptop that got damaged during shipment with the first stimulus check a couple years ago and sent it back, the shipper accused me of the damage and refused to refund or replace the laptop. 

spent the past 12 years in the dating scene and all I get is rejected because of my weight. told I am disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone or a relationship. laughed at, mocked at, made fun of and even told to kill myself because I am a joke. lead on by women who are married or pretending to want to get to know me and then faking their death on me or calling me while having sex with someone, leading me on for months to years, pretending to be single but are really married.

since I was 18 all I have wanted was a good woman to love and build a life with, now here I am 40 and only had sex once via a hooker and found out, I do not enjoy sex without feelings or emotions and can't get hard because I didn't have feelings for her and don't enjoy casual sex. 

 

I have spent over 20 yrs without being touched, hugged, or anything by anyone. I went to the dentist about 4 years ago and the assistant did a cancer screening on me, which involved feeling around my neck, skull, jaw line etc and I ended up having to leave and broke down crying hysterically because it felt so amazing being touched by another human being for once in my entire life. 

I can't keep living a life like this fighting and struggling and for nothing in return and being treated as if I was some kind of monster. I am done living and done with this life. I can't keep living being alone and single, unloved, uncared for missing out in having a real relationship with a woman who I love and care for and her love and care for me. both of us being intimate with each other etc.

I'm shitty towards my family, my friends and to myself. I honestly don't want to be alive because I feel like everyone I come in contact with will eventually become miserable like me. I think this started ever since I was a little girl. I've always been a really highly sensitive person and anxious person. Whenever someone treats me badly, I hold an enormous grudge against them. I desperately want them to feel the hurt I went through when they did what they did to me but you see, that always goes really badly. Whenever someone does or says something mean to me, I never tell it straight to their face but rather keep it inside until one day I explode and cry to someone else about it. The person always ends up finding out and honestly each time I feel really shitty about it. For example, recently, I had a group project that really stressed me out because I felt like I was the one putting more effort and time into it, so one day I couldnt take it anymore and I started to break down and I ranted about it to my teacher. I wasn't going to name names but then my teacher asked me about it and I had to answer because one way or another, she would've figured it out. I told her who my groupmates were and today, she scheduled a meeting with one of the groupmates that I pointed out. Also, this groupmate is known for not doing her work and it was true in my group as well, I did assign her work to do but she never done it and always said that she has no time. She only ever helped me out with minor stuff but honestly, I don't think it was enough. Out of all my groupmates, I felt like she was putting in the least effort and because of that I didnt really have anything nice to say about her to my teacher. However, after speaking with my teacher, I learned that she is really trying her best and is struggling with her work too and that made me think that I was being selfish and that I shouldnt have said anything about her at all...but thats too late...now she knows....besides that, she's also really close to my close friend in school but I'm too scared to say anything about her to my friend because I did not want us end up in a huge fight and I was certain that it would. Thus, I always resorted to being fake with her and agreed that she did a lot of work and even gossiped about my other groupmates behind their backs... But, my teacher end up telling her what I said and I think that her and my close friend hates me now...I also ended up worrying and crying about it to my mom and we ended up in a huge fight because she says that I always doing things like this and when it blows up on me I end up breaking down. She also says that I'm in the wrong for ranting to my teacher but I only did that because I know she's tired of listening to me rant and honestly I felt it was true that I felt stressed in that group project. During our fight, my mom and I said really mean things to each other and it really felt like I was stabbed in my back.

I know I deserve to be loved and appreciated but somewhere deep in me I'm starting to feel like that's a lie I tell myself to make it feel better. It scares me to say this out loud but I don't know if I even deserve to be loved, not because I feel that way but because it's been made clear to me time and time again by people in my life. 

Sure everyone says they love me, I believe them for the most part. Yet I'm crying alone because not even the people closest to me want to help me or they're in a situation where they can't help me. I don't blame them at all, it's only fair they put themselves first. It's really hard to believe they love me when I don't feel any of it.

a beautiful life and yet...,1,oyt0r3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyt0r3/a_beautiful_life_and_yet/,0,"*Excuse me for the grammar, I am not English.*

&#x200B;

I lived a ""beautiful"" life until now, I went to primary school in a small school in the village I live, I had a lot of fun and almost everyone in the school was my friends, then I had to go to the city for the secondary years and I realised how the world was very different than my small beautiful village plus almost all my old friends went to others school than me. But then again, I happened to make new friends who are great, I still meet them often and even if one of them died in a car accident, we are still a unite group, we even went together to his grave and bring some flowers.

Concerning grades school, everything is ok, I am able to study, even though I don't really like that, like a lot of people I guess. 

My parents aren't really strict, they just want me to do ""something"", they don't really care what, they even accept to pay the academic year and even though I don't know what I'm gonna do, which make me stress a lot, I am happy.

Or at least I should be, I live in a beautiful house in a wonderful village, I have a great family, I have some good friends and yet... I am far of being happy. First, I hate my family, I know that it seems strange since I said that they were great but... only on the surface. They always bring my mistakes and indecisions as jokes on the public conversations, may sound like they are worried about me and my future (which make me worried too) but it's juste to avoid the criticism of others about the fact that I'm the ""failed"" one. My 2 brothers succeed everything in life, they knew what they wanted to do from the very beginning and passed without real struggles and then there is me...

But if it was just that... Everytime I hang out with firends I just don't want to leave them, when I need to go to the bathroom, I feel like they are far from me and that I miss them even though I prefer being alone most of the time, lockdown didn't make me really suffer and I even have to say that I enjoyed it.

And now, I just feel the void inside me, I lived and I live the ""perfect"" life and yet, it didn't bring me anything spiritually talking, in the end it's a game who brought me my spiritual consciousness.I don't know if I have to thanks Persona 3 or curse it.

I want to live a simple life and yet I have the feeling that it's impossible, everything seems so difficult, so insurmountable and my parents keep putting pressure on me, telling me to choose even though I keep repeating that I don't know what to do and every day I know that I am approaching the moment my parents will tell me to go out, that they don't want someone who do nothing in their house.

in the end I am wondering if suicide is not best option, of course it will make my family and friends cry but I don't care, this feeling of emptiness is so strong. What is the point in leaving only for the sake of others? Does life need to be spend in fear and emptiness, just for some others humans, even though you love them?",1628201154.0,1

It’s been a while since I’ve written a note like this, last time being back in sophomore year; I remember abi rummaged through my phone and found them. So I think I have depression. I’m ready to admit that. It’s been this way since sophomore year, at least that’s what I remember. I’m the cause of it which is why I don’t seek treatment nor diagnoses from a doctor. I don’t have the balls to hear him make it official nor do I want to kill my psyche with a bunch of pills. I also like to think this madness fuels my creativity. It’s an extension of my craving for escapism, only difference being that creativity is much more productive and is seen as a positive attribute. Why do I think I’m depressed? Well to start, I used to write notes like this all the time in sophomore year. Albeit, the subject matter was much darker. All I would write about was about how much I hated this and that and how I wished this and that. A lot of sulking and self-loathing. In junior year it reached its peak as I started to develop something similar to a bi-polar disorder. I would breakdown in my tub, bathing in my tears and self-pity. I would be very sad for a period of about 4 days or so, but then I would be very happy for the next 3 or so days, and so on and so forth. Very weird. I would get a rush of dopamine followed by an intense lack of it, perpetually. Now it’s become a passive thing which is harder to notice but it’s there. It’s hard to get out of bed every day. The majority of the days I shower sitting down lacking the strength or will to stand. Recently it’s become a 50/50 split, but previously I’d sit in the shower everyday. Sometimes I’d even lay down. Sometimes I’d even shower with the lights off. Sometimes I’d even shower in silence. Sometimes I wouldn’t shower, I wouldn’t brush my teeth, I wouldn’t groom, and I wouldn’t clean my room. I’d feel awfully sluggish and lack motivation, then again this is nothing new. It’s the sinking feeling I’ve felt for the last couple years now. Luckily, I don’t experience any suicidal thoughts. I think that’s a bit of an anomaly but I’ll run with it. The reason being: I have dreams I wish to accomplish. That’s been enough to push me forward, yet not enough to motivate me. And that in it of itself adds to the sadness I feel. Not only do I feel insecure and lack self confidence, but I tend to bash myself because of my lack of progress. I feel as if I’m not doing enough to accomplish my goals. I’m constantly thinking that I can do more. I should be doing more. But I don’t. I don’t. During quarantine back in April, I was the happiest I had ever been. It’s not the momentary bliss you feel when you go out with friends, nor the rush of dopamine you feel after a milestone. It was contentment. Not the contentment you feel as you fall into a cycle, but the content you feel with progress. I was happy with the way I was going and my everyday actions. Imagine the sinking feeling turned to a floating feeling. How did I achieve this? Why have I fallen from this grace? Well, it’s all connected. I would complete my goals for the day, in turn that would make me happy with the day, this happiness would then boost my self esteem and confidence, then I’d feel motivated, this motivation would help me accomplish my goals, and so on and so forth. But now I lack motivation, my lack of motivation keeps me from completing my goals, not completing my goals makes me feel inadequate and worthless, then I lose motivation. I know I can break the cycle because I’ve done it before. But it’s hard. It’s possible. But it’s hard. Speaking upon it makes it sound easy, but living day by day, it’s hard. The momentary temptations can overwhelm me. I lack self control. My thoughts often work against me. I begin a goal or project, whatever it may be, but I’ll give up on it without following through. I have these bursts of motivation and creativity on occasion. They’re only that. Bursts. I may take advantage of them but I run out of fuel before I can reach my destination. I know what I must do. I just need to do it. Once I start the positive cycle it’ll begin to snowball and maintain itself. The only way to take it is day by day. Everyday I need to be victorious over myself. I don’t like saying I’m depressed because it’s a word of defeat. I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to die. It’s not like I enjoy this feeling. So I don’t get to use it as an excuse. Deep down I know my reasons for being where I am emotionally and mentally. I need to get off my ass and fix it. I got this. Just day by day, remember the things you want and the very rewarding outcome that awaits in the long run.",1628199404.0,1

First Experience With Depression (26/M) After Getting Cheated On and Put Through the Ringer,2,oylcug,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oylcug/first_experience_with_depression_26m_after/,2,"I was in an extremely complicated 6+ year relationship and found out from her about a month ago that she cheated on me. I didn't take a ton of time to process and tried my best to forgive even though there was some resentment after only a few weeks. This cheating episode was likely due to sexual incompatibility so we decided to take a ""non-exclusive break"" so my girlfriend could explore other relationships (same with me) and we could both take time to ourselves. I was interested in working on this relationship and was hesitant about the break but she pushed so much for it that I let it happen. After about a week, thoughts of her feeling the need to go to other people to fulfill sexual desires/physical intimacy go in my head and started to severely affect my self worth. I communicate my feelings and she immediately agrees to work on the relationship and ""focus on us."" 

I thought the situation was looking better and better by the day. However, I noticed a screenshot she sent her friend once that included messages from a guy friend of hers. Something along the lines of ""I wish we could cuddle and watch a movie right now."" I boiled with anger and sadness and am in disbelief she left that detail away from me. This was a friend I always had some worry about and expressed my concern to her several times in the past (she just wrote it off despite him giving weird signals). She later told me he told her he has feelings for her (just a few days ago) and that she has to figure out where she stands in this relationship and in her feelings for him. She said she had to weigh the pros and cons of me and him.

The roller coaster of the past few months has sapped me of all my energy and has drained a ton of my focus throughout the day. My productivity at work is markedly worse because I randomly get fixated on what happened and start feeling either sad or angry. My self worth is completely shot at this point because I feel as though I'm inadequate in the bedroom (the fact she went to someone else). Also, the fact that she has to weigh how she feels about me vs. him (after being in a 6+ year relationship) is CRAZY and makes me feel worthless. I think about killing myself. I think about what the easiest way to kill myself would be (jumping off a bridge, asphyxiation, OD). I think about how it'd be convenient if a truck were to run me over while walking on the street or if I were to find out I have late stage cancer. I have so much hurt and pain that I just want to end. Literally the only thing keeping me from doing this is that I do not want my parents to feel intense sadness, to make them alone, and leave my dog without me. 

I'm not sure what my question is. But if someone has tips for dealing with this stuff, focusing their attention on important real life things while these issues are happening, or ideas for channeling anger/depression, that'd be helpful",1628179064.0,1

So as these things go, it only got worse. Really, really severe depression. When I turned 21, I finally started therapy and taking antidepressants. So I’ve been doing therapy since then and in addition have tried antidepressants. I’ve currently been on the same one for about a year, but I’ve tried two others. They take depression from something really severe to moderate and mild levels.

I kind of realize I go through periods of depression whether I’m on antidepressants or not. So for a month or two maybe, I’ll feel awful. But then it’s as if one day, I just sort of snap out of it… and for a month or two I feel fine again. Not manic, not tons of energy, just relatively normal. 

The antidepressants seem to help the severity of the depressive episodes and perhaps even the length of time, but it doesn’t actually make the episodes go away.

As a cruel twist of fate it was yet again ripped from my outstretched palms. All I want is to experience happiness. All I want  is to smile again. I just want to feel. 

But not this. Anything but this. 


Its a wicked trick. A twisted game.
 My broken brain torments me by offering me the only one thing I've every truly wanted. It waves it in front of my face, like an owner with food for a dog, and then it cackles in glee, as it takes it away again before I can even get a taste of the sweet bliss.


 And then there's nothing...


Until there's something


. All it takes is a raised voice. Being told I'm not good enough. Little things I've dealt with fine for so long. Even being told truths, that I know. And then it comes back. The pain so bad I fall to the floor, unable to scream or even move for that matter. Its clawing at my throat, I can feel my heart breaking again. I can feel the pain. And it hurts. It hurts so bad I decide I never want to feel again if this is all there is. If this is my only reward then what is the point in trying? I should just get it over with and do it. Its not that hard. I know how. I know how to make the pain stop. I'm back to crying myself to sleep at night, and carrying my water bottle everywhere with me to prevent the tears from spilling over once more. If anyone knows it'll just get worse. They feed on pain after all. And then... I wake up one day after a week, a month, heck sometimes a year of this torture and then there's... 


Nothing.


 The storm inside of me has stopped. Even though the sun is yet to shine through the thicket of clouds, I have hope. 


Stupid hope. 


How stupid do I have to be to realise that it's not over. Its never going to be over. I'm just in the eye of the storm. Stronger winds are on their way. They always get stronger. And so it goes on. The horrific loop I am yet to escape from. The twisted game I never agreed to play. And its never going to end. I can lie about it and fight it, some times I can even ignore it. But I know that there is no way to win this game. The only way I'll ever be free is if If I beat the final boss. And who is the final boss you might ask?  


The final boss,


 is  me.",1628186749.0,1
Need suggestions for Anhedonia,2,oyiwas,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyiwas/need_suggestions_for_anhedonia/,1,"I've had MDD all my life, but for the passed 10 years it's evolved into an extreme Anhedonia, and I'm struggling to find a solution. I don't get any pleasure, motivation, or excitement from anything anymore. I used to have intense desire to draw, play video games, explore, etc. All those motivating feelings stopped as I entered my teen years (I'm now 28). I was on SSRIs as a kid and motivation wasn't an issue. It was mainly for suicidal tendencies and anxiety from my depression. However, since about 15 it's been a steep decline to Anhedonia. 

What I've done. 
I've bounced around all major SSRIs, and combined them with Wellbutrin XL to no avail. 
I've done lifestyle changes where I joined a gym and went at it 4 times a week for a year and gained 30lbs of muscle. 
I would get more sunlight.
Push myself into social gatherings with my best friends. 

Currently I'm back to 40mg prozac, but the only thing it helps is the darkened/suicidal thoughts. I just want to enjoy life again. It's been so long that I've forgotten what it's like. 

What meds have you tried that specifically helped your apathy/Anhedonia?",1628173143.0,1

My depression went untreated for almost 4 years, because... Why would I be depressed? There was nothing wrong with my life. I was going to middle school, learning pretty well, having a lot of friends. Needless to say it's all gone now.

I'm now almost 20 and I've been depressed for 6 years. These years have ruined me. I'm a different person now. I'm supposed to be an adult, but I barely take care of myself. I have no friends. Routines, like university or jobs, scare me senseless. I feel I will never be normal again. 

And all of this... For no reason. 

Just, at some point, at 14 years of age, I became broken. I was tired every day. I didn't feel good anymore. And so many people told me it's not real depression. That I'm just growing up. That it's just my personality, because I was always so whiny. That it's impossible to get help. That someone's sister went to a psychiatrist and they denied her medication. That I will never get better. Because... There is nothing to fix. I'm normal. Nothing happened to me. During the worst time of my life, when I was self harming and planning suicide, nobody noticed me. Because why would they? I had good grades, I was just weird for crying every day during classes. 

There are people who are homeless. Who got their lives ruined. Who got kicked out of their family. Who had their significant other die. Who got their hearts broken. Who watched their children perish to cancer. Who miscarried. Who got assaulted. Who got scammed out of everything. Who are jobless, almost to get evicted and who don't have family to fall back on. Who are complitely alone. There are so many people in such deep pain. 

And I dare to be depressed? It feels like I'm just pretending. 

My mother had depression for a period of time, because her husband divorced her and lied about her to everyone so she almost lost all of her support, and she was about to have her children taken away. My father had depression for a period of time, because he had to see horrors on the job, had to look at broken homes, murdered people and still be efficient. My brother had depression for a period of time, because his parents were getting divorced, and he was lied to so much that he hated his own mother, he was then faced with his father mistresting him and then was bullied for years.

And I'm just... Depressed. For years. For no reason. How dare I?",1628157796.0,1

My parents hit me when I was a kid, they never showed up to any school event where parents where invited, being born on the edge of the school year boundary instead of being kept down like everyother kid I was made to go up a year meaning I was the youngest in my class and thus isolated and never able to keep up both academicly or socially with anyone in my class.

I went to a secondary school more than and hour away, always the last person on the bus and so my social life as a teenager was none existant, because I was always tired from having to wake up early to get to school people always called me a school shooter as a joke and would try to fight me and when ever I beat them up in self defence I was always the one punished despite the school having cctv showing I was the victim. My school cheated and was happy to leave people like me behind and only offered to help to the students who didn't need it, like giving the top of the class top grades students extra time on exams.

Whenever there is a competition I never win, even when I try my hardest, working myself to the bone the winner is either some half baked pity winner or someone with the advantage of having more money, time and connections.

I'm in constant pain with both my wrists hurting all the time, my left side hurting due to complications at birth and the right side for compensating for the left.

I shower and shave, try to look after myself yet even on the most crowded of public transport people don't sit next to me.

At work my coworkers forget about me, despite being 4 of us they only put three chairs and desks for all of us despite being room for 4 and the desks and chairs already existing.

After two years of being in my room all alone I finally worked my ass off to get into uni, and met her. The only girl I've ever had feelings for. I've always wanted to be in a relationship but never found a girl I liked, yet despite her asking me out, despite the fact she said she was happy and had fun with me she chose to just be friends. Even when I tried my hardest and the girl said I did nothing wrong they still left and so there goes the only person I've ever had feelings for.

My entire life I've had everything stacked against me, when I work as hard as I can i never get anymore out of it than if I did nothing. People treat me like an after thought and the only person who made me happy doesn't want to be with me. No matter what I do and try life never gives me a break.

I have no passion for anything. I used to love writing - I can’t anymore. 

I used to love working in sports - I have no creativity or energy for it. 

I used to love doing things but I honest to god have no passion for jack shit anymore. It’s probably coming off in my job interviews but tbh I just don’t have it. 

I don’t feel cut out for the world. And though I’m not at the point of hurting myself, I’d be lying if I said I haven’t thought about the easiness of not existing. 

I have an appointment with my doctor in two weeks but who knows.

Talked about my situation, was at low point, family problems, loneliness, so like explaining the affects of long term abuse from parents on me now, 3 years later (depression, dissaccociation, paranoia etc) - they asked me if I was suicidal or self harmed, I told them I researched about it and listened to songs related to it, but I told them I wouldn't do either as it's not a good thing to do etc. I also told them I walk 2 hours a day, which I do most days, I felt by saying that they won't take me as serious. I have to do something all the time to get out of my head

The abuse was emotional abuse from when I was a kid up until 17. I felt like I was wasting their time as I said I wouldn't off myself, I don't want to, I just want the pain to end, I tried to explain that but messed it up. 

I'm now getting 6 CBT sessions (over the phone...meh) in a few weeks, I'm glad I got help and that quickly. Of course. I don't know how to feel about it. I feel 6 sessions isn't enough, but I will give it a try.

However, for all the middle class people who already have their basic needs met (or for teens/kids who do not have to worry about money yet), do you think money could directly improve your mental health?

I was just applying for jobs and I cannot explain how much I hate the process and how much I wish I was just rich because I cannot stand people and I cannot imagine having to listen to a boss's rules again or fake a whole persona to hide my depression. In this case, I wish I was rich so that I can keep isolating myself and keep avoiding people who I do not wanna be around. Having to act like I am fine or like I enjoy following rules makes me anxious and more depressed and lonely. In this case, I do not think money would cure my depression but it would prevent me from falling into the deeper depression that comes with having to fit into a mold and caring about others' opinions of me. The excessive, unnecessary material things that people associate with wealth would not make me happy but having the financial stability and freedom to spend my time however I want around whoever I want would certainly remove a lot of my anxiety.

I've been a bit lost in life I admit since graduating college almost 5 years ago, but a few years ago I realized what used to be fun no longer is. I used to play video games with my friends and still do but feel no joy, I only do it to be able to speak with them. I started baking but I realize I do it to get my mind off things it's not fun it's an accomplishment possibly. 

I started Therapy January 2020 and brought this up with my Therapist that I can't find anything that is fun a few months ago but they didn't say much to my statements and we moved on. I do have anxiety however, right now it's actually much lower than it's ever been. Before they left for vacation almost a month ago they said I have the positive and negative of too much time as I work part time. 

I'm really lost in life right now and was working with a Career Coach and one of the final questions was again something similar if money, expenses didn't matter what would I do for fun. I sat for hours until 2 am thinking and couldn't come up with anything.

The world in general I realize I feel a bit lost, each suburb seems the same and the city raises my anxiety. I don't know where I belong or what to do. There's just wondering what to do and no time for fun or I can't figure out what is/ would be fun. Long walks are relaxing but not fun.

Is this maybe just a phase while I try to get a sense of direction in life? Then things will start showing up that seem fun? If everyday feels the same and the days blend into each other how do you take time off for fun?",1628172485.0,1

Sertraline Has Helped Massively,2,oyegv2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyegv2/sertraline_has_helped_massively/,2,"I'm on about week 7 of sertraline now and I can honestly say it has worked wonders. I'm 22 and 23 in a few days, i have been depressed starting from like the age of 13, 14, struggled with anxiety too and a bunch of other things that turned out to be adhd which i was diagnosed with in January. I tried the 3 main types of adhd medication including both types of stimulant, to no avail. When i was on the stimulants i was out of work, not in a routine and depressed, my mood was so up and down but mostly down. I stopped taking them as they were having no effect and decided to try anti-depressants for a while. And oh boy have they helped. So at first i felt no different and maybe a bit more suicidal in the first 2 weeks or so but by tye 4th week i could tell the difference, and now in week 7 I feel good for once. I never have the super low lows i used to, i do have low mood sometimes but not as often. Week 3 to 6 i felt pretty numb, not bad, but also not good. But this week has been good so far i have a lot more energy to do things i feel like. I have started going to the gym again 3 weeks ago and am enjoying it again like i used to. If i forget to take my medication for a day,by the end of the day I can tell. So I'm not totally fixed yet, but I finally have some progress.

I have far less negative thoughts. I used to have intrusive thoughts that were almost obsessive as well. It was always a downward spiral, like thinking about my girlfriends rape or other things that really upset me. I'm I finally have sorted out my room after years, and actually enjoyed doing it. As i have adhd i still get hyperfixated on stuff and obsessive thoughts, but recently it has been about decorating my room and finding new furniture i like for it.

Idk it was tough, I'd feel bad even when nothing was wrong, i coudl think about nothing but just feel bad like there was some negative energy possessing my brain. But i don't have that anymore.

Also having sex and things with my girlfriend has been a lot better in some ways. I feel a lot more sensitive down there and get stronger sensations which is great. The downside is I am finding it hard to climax and have only managed to by myself a couple of times in the last 4 weeks.

The adhd issues still bother me and upset me sometimes, but i think it would be good to try the stimulants again in the future when my mood is more stable, and I'm in a position where it is only the adhd symptoms affecting me",1628157903.0,1

How to get rid of the victim mentality? Is therapy keeping me stuck in the past?,5,oyamz1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyamz1/how_to_get_rid_of_the_victim_mentality_is_therapy/,1,"I have been seeing a therapist on a weekly basis for about 8-9 months now and during almost every single session we bring up my childhood and we are always able to connect one of my current issues to my childhood.

Why did I treat food as a reward when I was in college and starved myself until I got my work done? Because my mom wouldn't cook me food when she was mad at me when I was a kid. Why is my inner voice so harsh on myself and so focused on my flaws? Because my mom always focused on my flaws and overlooked my accomplishments when I was a kid. Why am I so insecure about my appearance? Because my mom always told me I am ugly and that I do not have a single good quality and compared me to every other kid she knew.

While it is nice to be able to identify the source of all of these toxic behaviors and self-sabotage and to know that is not all my fault, sometimes I feel like all this analysis just keeps me stuck in the past and angry at my mom who is now actively trying to improve her relationship with me. I feel like I am always internally fighting with my mom and sometimes I do get in arguments with her over that stuff which she finds burdensome. Sometimes she admits that she screwed up and other times she says that I have always been free to do whatever I want and that my current situation is my fault. Regardless of my mom's response, I just wanna get over the past. I wanna stop thinking about all of this. Is it possible that therapy is making me hold on to baggage that I just wanna get rid of? Sometimes I feel like the victim mentality is holding me back and keeping me from taking responsibility for my action.

Losing hope,2,oyd99o,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyd99o/losing_hope/,1,"Hello, I’m Thomas..
My name is one of the very few things I still know about myself. To keep things shortish I won’t go through my whole childhood. Ever since middle school I’ve dealt with severe anxiety, which soon or later also lead to severe depression. The only thing that got me through these times and kept a smile on my face were video games. I’m 25 years old now and will be 26 in two months time, I have absolutely nothing going for me and it KILLS me. After high school I was drafted to a junior hockey team where I played for a year, nothing really came of it. During this time, on one of our breaks I came home to see my family. Everything seemed normal until one day I walked into my garage to find my mom in a running vehicle with the garage door shut and yelled for my dad, thankfully we were able to get her out of the vehicle and to the hospital. This is just one moment in my life where I believe my brain chemistry just changed FOREVER. I’ve lost my ability to trust anyone or get too close to anyone because of this incident and a few others that I feel don’t need to be mentioned. I’ve never really been close to my family or my extended family because my parents always had an issue with EVERYONE. I also lost literally every single one of my friends that I knew for years because of my anxiety and the fact that they all had things going for them and I have nothing going for me, so that made it hard to face them, I felt like a failure. I became comfortable with people I’ve met online, I considered and still consider them some of the best people I’ve ever met. Going back, after my season in Dallas ended I came home and went to a community college online for two years, due to my anxiety problems I simply couldn’t gain the courage to go to class in person. Being that the classes were online, this basically meant I was still gaming all of the time. Fast forward to now, I’ve had probably 5 or 6 jobs that I can never hold for more than 3 months. I feel like such a loser, I have no job currently, crippling anxiety and depression, no credit score, I don’t pay any of my bills, I just do not know what to do anymore. I’ve been in and out of counseling and I can’t go back on medication because I won’t be under my parents insurance anymore soon. I feel like time has caught up to me and my only way out of this pain is to just end it. I stay up until 5-6am just thinking of how I can turn my life around and I can’t think of a reasonable path. Thinking of going back to work even makes me anxious, it’s that bad. The worst part is my parents just think I’m lazy, but I’m not. It’s the opposite, I want a normal life where I can go to work and feel like I’ve contributed to society, but my mental issues have quite literally never allowed me to work without being overwhelmed and most of the times walking out of some jobs even on day one during training. I just don’t know anymore.. my laptop and pc were taken from me, as sad as that sounds at 25 years old. Those were my outlet where I felt at peace and had people to talk to for the last 10 years. It’s been two weeks since I’ve had those taken from me and I just feel like there’s just nothing left to live for anymore. The last two weeks I’ve laid in my room with only my phone all day to avoid my family until they go to bed, then I get up and eat something. I can’t believe I am where I am, I used to be fit, motivated, and had friends. I’m just so lost and alone.",1628152189.0,1

You don't understand: I am the most jealous and bitter person alive.,3,oyappj,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oyappj/you_dont_understand_i_am_the_most_jealous_and/,0,"Say, if you were writing book and I'm your best friend who you know likes to write. You ask me for ideas on a certain part. I'm all about you, boo. I give you every idea, every angle, I'm obsessed with your work (in the way that's outpouring support), I check in with you on it every so often, and I tell you how I KNOW it's gonna get published, to not feel uncertain in your talent and that when it does, I will buy ten copies.

Then, when the book gets published and you're rolling in success and happiness, I actually do buy ten copies, no, I buy fifteen. I'm so goddamn happy for you, it's my favourite book. I tell all my friends and family about it, how it is the best goddamn thing and that they need to go buy a copy.

But deep on the inside, through caves upon caves, I also hate you. I hate you so much. Because your success and happiness just reminds me of how little and meaningless I am and that I'll never be as successful as you. I'll never have this moment, and if I tried, something would happen where it would be taken away.

But you'll never know. You'll never have a clue.

You may think this isn't so bad but...it is.

I can't stand celebrities and I love when they're not good people because that gives me all the more reason to hate them. I hate their money, their talent, their looks, and their perfect little lives. From Bella Poarch to Beyoncé, if i see anything related to them on social media, they get an instant dislike from me.

I love KPOP/JPOP music but i often can't listen to it because I get too jealous. WHY couldn't I have been born this genetically flawless amazing star? Why couldn't it have been me? Why can't I be this talented and beautiful?

Don't even get me started on romance. I hate couples. 

For amazing people like Chadwick Boseman, if soul trading was a thing, I'd give mine to him. I am useless and have no worth and he was someone who was gone too soon, suffered when he shouldn't have. If I could have traded places with him, I would have.

Why do I have to be this homely looking mixed girl whose parents don't even think is worthy enough to have any effort put into her? What did I do to deserve THIS? Everything about my birth was an ACCIDENT: I wasn't planned, I wasn't wanted, I'm a twin but my twin died, i was born at home because they didn't get the hospital on time, my name was misspelled- need I go on?

I will say, just to be a bit clearer here, is that I never ever wish bad things on anyone or do anything underhanded (the most negative I could be towards someone I'm super jealous of is to keep them at a  distance because it just...hurts. Their happiness and positivity just fucking hurts). I wouldn't dream of doing that and if something bad happens to a celebrity that I ""admire"" (as much as I'm capable of anyway), then I'm outpouring support to them and upset too.

IT'S. NOT. FAIR. IT'S. NOT. FAIR.

But, fuck...why did I have to be me? Why can't I be someone else? Different race, different place, different time, and with different people around me? Why do I have to be stuck with me?

I'm a self not worth having.",1628140194.0,1

A rant,3,oy9mo4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy9mo4/a_rant/,0,"Sorry but I am not even creative enough to come with a nice title

Sooooo, how should I start.

So I was diagnosed with depression when I was in 8th grade,now I just completed my 1st year of diploma .so I be having my 4 year anniversary to my beloved depression. 

The reason for depression,1 I was bullied, harassed, abused by my classmate from 1st grade to the last day of 10th grade.

2 my parents denied me every chance to grow as a person , the total number of trips I went to during my school years is astonishing 4. I didn't even got the chance to join any hobbies. The 1 I had was drawing but that was also shutdown by my parents as they thought It will interfere with my studies. 

3 everytime I went through mental breakdown, my family told me I was being manipulative and emotionally abusing them.

Other than these 3 reasons I have a friend group that are kind but how long will they keep me alive I don't know.

I thought of writing this because today morning I was playing game the ascent (you should try it ,it's a very cool game)I  am getting kinda good at playing and my mom was watching me as she was having tea.she said you are very good at playing game maybe you should try making one.i responded back making games is hard ,and I am only good at playing them otherwise I am worthless.my mom shuts up,but the word that came out of my mouth, sting me. I stopped playing and went straight into deep coma of depressing thought.
After that I started writing .

Not to mention my bouts of anger during my depressive episodes can get aggressive and while I probably wont hit my dog, I dont want to scare my dog or accidentally throw something that hits them unintentionally. I just dont know if I'd be able to care for a dog properly. I dont think I can talk my parents out of this unfortunately, and making money to afford therapy as a college student is iffy.

I'm not sure how I feel at this point in my life. Maybe a little sad/happy? I'm not sure. I'm at a point in my life where I've reached and was working toward my dream job until I failed some tests and now I'm out of the program. It sucks. I've been living in a smaller city than the one I came from and hate absolutely hate it. Luckily I will be moving back to said city soon.

My girlfriend and I split up 9 months ago and I still very much hang on to that sadness, but I'm trying to get better from it. Life has been hard. I've been lonely and I mainly just sit in my room and go to the gym while I'm still here in this city. I really have no more effort to give in this place. I absolutely hate it and I've explored everything here. And with the new covid restrictions in place I'm not allowed to leave this city (can't go into much more detail then that.)

So right now I'm just kinda riding out my final month here in this terrible place. 2020-2021 has been the hardest time period of my life. I've lost my job and my girlfriend. And a good majority of my friends. I hope the future gets better.",1628121220.0,1

' and that kinda just, ruined me. i'm in a new school now but people from my old one talk to people at my new school so.. yeah lovely.. i don't wanna say i have depression but i think that i do, i have a doctors visit coming up, so i'll ask there. i just feel tired, exhausted, i feel more.. angered??, i have no reason to wake up anymore, it's hard for me to eat or do simple tasks like brushing my teeth, i have thought of suicide but i don't want my parents to get mad at me for trying. i don't even wanna tell my parents about the depression, if i have it. i'm scared of what they'd say to me, like would they be disappointed, will they treat me as if it was a lie, i'm not sure if i could exactly trust them either, my moms bestfriend gossips to everyone and she'd tell this bestfriend and everyone would know. my parents are also nagging me to clean my room but i have no motivation or anything to do it.

I tried relentlessly to get her to talk to me but she just ended up filing a restraining order against me.

She works 5 Miles from where we were living so she’s always coming close.

for context, he has major depressive disorder and is seeing a therapist and on meds. we have asked him what he wants to do in the future - what interests he wants to pursue - and his answer is always ""nothing."" he has no zest for life whatsoever. 

it wasn't always this way. he used to be an avid artist and pianist, as well as a straight A student. this year, he has fallen into a debilitating downward spiral and has quit all his former activities. he threatens that he will run away from home if we enroll him into school this year. 

we're not certain what caused his sudden abhorrence for school, but we're guessing it stemmed from his psych ward stay in april. he'd been in inpatient care for a week due to suicidal ideation. as a result, he missed a chunk of school and fell behind on assignments. this hit him hard, and he decided to give up altogether on academics. 

we have no idea what to do with him. in our state, it is against the law to drop out of school before the age of 18. it's a week before enrollment day, and we have yet to get him on board with attending school.",1628098131.0,1
I gave up on making friends because I feel too ashamed of my past. I have no one and I'm so depressed rn.,7,oy3s2p,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy3s2p/i_gave_up_on_making_friends_because_i_feel_too/,2," 

   A bit of background here: I'm 26, for a year I've been working as a delivery guy, my life isn't terrible compared to what it used to be, but still I feel like I won't be able to escape my past no matter what I do, that's why I gave up seeking friends, relationship is out of discussion.  
Since 16 my life's been going downhill. I started hanging out with people that had a very bad influence on me, resulting in dropping out high school and seeking opportunities in drug trade. At 19 I was arrested for drug sale and possession, spent 3 years in prison. After I got out, my life was still spiralling out of control: I wasn't able to leave my drug life behind and became addicted to heroin and almost died from a OD. I've been in a rehab centre for almost two years. I attempted suicide twice whilst being there, if it wasn't for the vigilant eyes of the staff I'd be gone.  
Eventually I made some progress, got released and once again I had to face the outside world.   
Since then it's been tremendously difficult for me to open up to someone about my past, but even more difficult to find a job having a criminal record. Like I said earlier I've been working as a delivery guy for a year now, I'm very grateful to my boss who decided to give me a chance and hire me, also probably the only good thing I did when I was younger was getting a driver's license which is a game changer at this moment.  
I didn't dare thinking about making friends because that could distract me from being productive at work but more than I'm just to afraid of what people would think about me, if they're going to judge me if I eventually tell them about my past.  
At first I thought about  opening up to at least one person but as time passes I realise I'd probably be on my own my whole life.  
It's not just my past, a lot of things have changed in society and I was completely gone from this world, I feel like I missed out so many great things in the past 6 or 7 years. I can't talk about a movie, TV or video game that came out in recent years because I never experienced it. One thing that I always liked was watching football but the enjoyment isn't the same knowing I missed so many great games that happened previously. When someone attempts to chit-chat with me I literally don't know what subject to bring up, I just let them talk about themselves and nod my head. Social media is not appealing to me, it actually makes me feel more miserable when I see people I used to know being successful and having a family, while I'm only having a year of employment.  
My life is slowly but surely becoming a mundane existence, I only work, eat, sleep and avoid any human interaction other than the one I'm suppose to do at work. I have a 8hrs shift but I usually work more than that with no extra pay. It's not like I have to, my boss actually insists that I only do my regular shift, but I keep telling him I must repay the government for all those years I've been a burden to the system. It's some kind of form to seek absolution. That isn't necessarily a lie it's just that I don't really have anything else better to do. Last Friday I had a 14hrs shift and didn't even feel bad about it. I earn enough, only spend my money on food and bills, I don't have to pay rent hence I live in my parents' house(they passed away few years ago).  
Lately my mental health has slightly deteriorated knowing I have to face this loneliness every day. I have no one to talk to, all the people I knew are no longer available or have better things to do than talking to a wreck who reached out to them after all these years. I know there might be people who went through similar experiences but I can drag myself to search for them, I feel like I will never find a person to resonate with.   
I tried my best to take care of myself, in three months I'll be two years of drug free, sometimes I exercise, always keep my house clean and spend more time on the internet trying to catch up on all the things I missed. I really don't want to rely on antidepressants to improve my mental health I'm afraid of the effects they might have on me. But again I feel like the past will always haunt me. I'm so afraid of other's reaction and judgment.Recently I noticed this tendency of canceling someone based on what they're said or done years or even decades ago. If I'll ever be in a better position than today and someone would digg up my past they'll probably crucify me and this chills me to the bone.

I feel like I haven't done anything with my life lately (the past year or so). Whether it is anything productive such as pursuing my education or smaller events such as watching a tv show I have been meaning to catch up on, there has always been a small voice at the back of my head telling me that I am wasting my time, and this is not what I should be doing.  At this point, doing anything short of laying in bed all day and sleeping feels like a monumental mental task which I have to consciously force myself to even begin. For the past month or two, I have spent about every day either sleeping for 15+ hours or staring at the ceiling for hours on end.  I try my best to get out of bed when I eventually wake up but oftentimes, I never proceed any further beyond that. I end up feeling indecisive about completing any basic task such as brushing my teeth or watering my plants to the point I end up doing nothing and returning to my bed. I have felt the same discomfort with doing the hobbies I once loved, where I feel scared to even enjoy them. Its as if some part of me just feels like I don't deserve to do anything in life but lay in painful contempt longing for the things I end up not doing last second.

Hi , im a 31 yr old living at home cos of circumstances. My family is not great, i feel so overwhelmed all the time, while they are not outright bad people, we are just a dysfunctional family . To make matters worse i have no space of my own, i dont have a room , i have to share my room, theres no place i can be at peace and just think , and whatever time i find alone , i waste brooding and doing the bad coping skills ive developed like mindlessly scrolling social media. Despite my mental problems whenever i try to get my life on track something or the other drama happens and i have to recover from that. I wish i was self absorbed person but im highly attuned to other people and it just drains me. Im poor i cant find lodgings of my own, im trying to apply to a school, but i feel so depressed sometimes i feel like giving it all up. I dont want to list my problems here cos its endless, and i feel physically weak from my situation. And the pandemic has made things worse, the libraries are closed , i cant even go there. I just want to be at peace with myself and remember that my life matters, and that i can focus on getting out of here, because everything just overwhelms me . I live in a 3rd world country so all the mental health infrastructures are BS, if anyone can teach me how to cope, it would be great . Thanks

The only thing that gave me hope in the last couple of months was my best friend who I've developed feelings for. Today is the day I want to confess to them.

All they say is ""you're intelligent, if you take this up it'll be awesome, you'd do a great job"" or ""stop hiding away from everything, keep running away from things, how long you want to keep avoiding things"" this puts me under immense pressure and guilt. Just to make them feel better or not wanting to disappoint them, I force myself to accept whatever job related tasks they make me do.

The problem is that they believe I'm intelligent and maybe I actually am, at least, to some extent, but sometimes I feel really dumb unable to even utter a proper, coherent sentence. I forget to speak the language and I feel like an inefficient teenager trapped in a so-called adult's body. My body language gets me embarrassed and I get intimidated by intelligent folks. I don't want to make a fool of myself.

I'd be happy to do anything that doesn't put me in the spotlight. I'm more of a behind-the-desk worker (unfortunately the act of 'educating' doesn't come with this privilege) than a forward, spontaneous one.

I'm sinking in a ton of my own guilt and embarrassment whenever I decline. There are so many young ones out there who are making so much much money and have a good profile and here I am rotting away like dead meat even though I'm young too. 

I'm not focusing only on my negatives but they are overpowering my positive attributes. I've taken up such things and have spent many sleepless nights, anxiety and have put myself through so much. I don't want to be struggling with the simple things that others seem to be doing without any care. 

If I even think about dressing up to face something or meet any (seemingly) intelligent adults, I feel like a goat being taken for slaughter (apologies. couldn't think of anything better).

I am at a totally different point in my life today than I would have ever guessed at the start of the year.

Going into 2021 and for the first few months of 2021, most things were right for me. Focused in school, working a part time job, going to the gym regularly, eating good, in an amazing relationship with the most amazing girl in the whole world, and I had gotten accepted into my dream school for this coming fall semester. had some serious issues with a few people at school but I learned to deal with it and my girlfriend was by my side through it all. I guess you could say I had most things going right for me, but was dying to get out of high school because it was a mess at times.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this past May, I am in the middle of exams at school which are stretched over a 3 week period when I'm sitting at a red light and get rear ended by a car going full speed.

I was sobbing, this was my breaking point and at that moment, I knew everything was going to go downhill for me. I also knew I was going to do horribly on my exams now. I had already overcome a stressful school year, and this was the cherry on top. In the moment of the accident, I didn't have any serious injuries at the moment besides a busted lip and loose front teeth, but I spent the next week or so crying through my exams just angry with my luck this school year. 

A week later, I started feeling like shit from the accident. Feeling nauseous and slow, terrible headaches. Awful pain in my back and neck, lip still hurting from the bruise and front teeth loose and in pain as well. Spend the next few weeks in pain, come to find out I have a bad herniated disc in my c spine and a muscle tear in my neck which can take up to a year and a half to heal, I was devastated. 

Started physical therapy a couple months ago and seeing a ton of different doctors for all the issues now, and today my back and neck are worse than when it firs started. Feeling pain and tingling in my arms and legs from it, I feel like it's never going to get better after 3 months of no improvement.

Because I am not doing any better present day from my injuries, I had to turn down my dream school and go to a shitty college close to home so I can continue therapy and keep my doctors.  I worked so hard this whole year to get into that school, just for everything to get tossed out by this accident which was not even my fault, just wrong place wrong time. I won't ever get over the work I put in this year through all the stress just to not be able to go to the school I was so excited about and looked forward to for so long.

In June, I find out one of my old coworkers took his own life. We weren't super close, but I cared for him a lot and loved him as a person. I will never forgive myself for not reaching out to him and checking up on him after he quit the job. Maybe he just needed to know that somebody was there for him and cared for him. I know it isn't my responsibility, but who knows. I can't let this guilt go, I should have done something for him and I didn't, and now it is probably my biggest regret ever.

&#x200B;

In the middle of this timeframe between the accident and now, I have also had a couple of heated arguments with my girlfriend, both being my fault for the most part. I have gotten so sensitive and will get mad over anything, pushing away the people I love and care for most. Luckily we were able to get through it, but they were pointless and a result of me being bitchy, possibly because my doctors have prescribed me 7 different medicines and different combinations  I feel like I'm spiraling out of control.

Another benefit of my dream school was being close to my girlfriend and where she's going. Now I won't be as close, and I'm stuck at home for the year. She has been my rock through it ALL since the start of our relationship March of 2020. I don't know where I would be without her today, she has done everything for me and supported me through everything. She was there for me when nobody else was. She stood up for me when nobody else would, and she spends so much of her energy caring for me and looking out for me. She deserves the world. But she leaves for school next week and I'm terrified to keep on going without her by my side. I'm scared that our relationship will fail since we are kind of far away, and that is the absolute last thing I need. I need her support, even if she's half way across the country. I need for her to be there with me, because I don't think I can keep going through this alone for who knows how long. I have cried myself to sleep late into the night wondering how I can keep going with everything just seeming to get worse for me. Nothing is going my way anymore and it feels like it wont for a long time.

My plan now is to spend this year going to college close to home, that way I can recover fully and then transfer to a much better school where I would be much happier. So I guess I can see when things will start falling back into place. I just need to fully recover soon, transfer, hope my girlfriend is still with me, and things will start to work out. But it's such a long road ahead, and everyday I think about how I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I've lost all happiness and have nothing encouraging me.

&#x200B;

I recently got a really great offer for a job, $30 AUD per hour, 40 hours a week. I went the first day, found out my manager got fired. Found out I was meant to have experience even though my resume didn't have any. Got paranoid and sent some emails saying I was quitting. They rejected a recent timesheet so I thought they were trying not to pay me. I sent some really nasty emails threatening to go to the Fair Work Ombudsman. Turns out I fucked up the time sheet, probably made the poor woman of a small business incredibly stressed. Insulted the management of the company. 

Me and my boyfriend had an argument that night over something really small that I had an issue with. He became suicidal and self-harming. Needed help from his nan and a roommate to help him. I couldn't help him. He didn't want me anywhere near him. Got him some vallium to get him to sleep. It worked thankfully and knocked him out. 

A person I looked up to is very disappointed in me for losing my job I just got. I can't seem to keep them because of my fluctuating paranoia and stupid feelings.

This doesn't seem to get better. I was always told I had a lot of potential, always performed well in school despite being a little shit. Try really hard when I am working.

I have anxiety and depression and I've been actively trying to work on my abandonment issues since a really hard breakup last summer, it seems things got a bit better, I made some big (for me) steps by myself, but I don't know how to keep improving. It's easier to get better in the face of adversity, if I didn't push through it then, I don't know how I could've kept going at all, but having things be more comfortable now, I don't know how to keep improving. I started therapy towards the end of last year, but sadly I don't feel comfortable with the only therapist I can afford, so it hasn't been helping. I've been with my new boyfriend for a few months now, and I want to be as healthy as I possibly can be in this relationship, I don't wanna spiral into thinking he's gonna leave me and feel like I can't deal with it all over again if he does. Some nights, something triggers that fear and I start crying and thinking very irrationally, I've been able to get my thoughts together after I cry it out and slowly move on from it the next day, the fact that he's good to me probably helps. These last few days I haven't been feeling too well, being more emotional makes it harder to see things in a more rational way, I had a bad day, and just came down from a panic attack thinking about possibly losing my boyfriend, and I'm tired of feeling that way, I don't wanna hurt like that, I really try my best, but thing is, I don't know what to try, I don't know where to turn. Most times I keep these freak outs to myself and if he asks what's up I just tell him I'm having a hard time with my abandonment issues, cause I don't wanna stress him, and guess what, I'm scared if I disclose too much he's gonna become distant, and you know, leave. I wanna know, if any of you struggle with, and mproved their abandonment issues, what is something that clicked for you, regarding making the thought of being abandoned more bearable? Even something that helped just a little bit? Or your thought process during a turning point? The most random thing, don't be afraid to share.

I watch others be happy whilst feeling like i’m alone. i’m fucking lonely. 

i’ve been isolated. had things I care about and grown attached to taken from me.
-for long periods of time 
-receiving gifts could never be my love language. the tangible can be taken. 

everything is temporary. everyone is temporary. 

but when i’m alone, i’m damaged. when i’m with people, i’m damaged. 

if you open up, you lose everyone. if you open up, you won’t be heard. 

I don’t cry on deaf ears. I add another drop to my ocean of torment. 

i am unwanted
-lest I am perfect 

thrown away

abandoned 

I need to be punished.

if I could take myself from everyone, not the other way around, they’d learn. 

emotions can never be felt right. not in moderation but extremes. 

when behind the wheel I think too often about suicide.
-speeding into a brick wall. slamming into oncoming traffic.

I wanna die fast and instantly. will only kill myself with if I KNEW I couldn’t come back. I don’t wanna have to explain myself or be disabled 

I can’t get help. I won’t help myself

time is a concept. get drunk whenever you want

ever conscious of the shadowy veil separating me from everyone else 

running to stand still 

it’s like i’m screaming and everyone else is deaf.",1628138047.0,1
Some kind of numbness😐,1,oya51n,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oya51n/some_kind_of_numbness/,0,Ok so basically I’ve been having this like numbing wtv it is. My stomach gets hungry but I can sense the disconnection when it goes to my brain. It’s like if it doesn’t care. There is no physical sensations of craving food if you know what I mean. Same goes with getting angry. I would get angry but I feel this like freezing that is blocking me from fully feeling my anger as I use too. I know I’m super pissed. But It feels like my brain is not well connected to what I’m feeling. It’s super hard to describe. It’s like your brain numbs you out does someone get what I’m saying. Same goes with tempature.

I have no social life and i feel numb,1,oya011,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oya011/i_have_no_social_life_and_i_feel_numb/,2,"I used to be a push over.

I let friends bully me back then because for them it was an inside joke and it was just a friendly joke for them.

But ever since quarantine started, i felt so lonely. I was home alone 24/7 and I didnt have anyone to talk to. I talked to my friends occasionaly but i could tell they got annoyed with me.

Eventually i got a boyfriend. They made fun of me for it and often joked about how we were not going to official and if we were, it was not going to last. Eventually i stopped talking to them.

After a few months i invited them to play on my minecraft server. We played but one of my boyfriend's friend got uncomfortable because one of them was making sexual comments about him. Basically sexual harrasment. I only found out a few months after and decided to confront my friend about it. In response, she said: ""snowflake"". I was furious. 

I said to her: ""dick and drugs changed you huh?""

She got mad and blocked me. A friend of ours mssged me telling me she just got overwhelmed as she was experiencing problems at home. And i was confused because that still doesnt explain the snowflake part.

Since then i lost friends. All of them stopped talking to me and sided with her. I get why, they were closer to her. One of my friends that i loved hanging out with blocked me on all social media.

So i only really had my boyfriend and his friends.

Me and my boyfriend used to call 24/7 until he told me he wanted to just call time to time instead of 24/7 because he needed alone time. I agreed and now we are not on call.

Im lonely. I have no social life. I dont have friends, his friends ony talk to me if they want someone to play with, and my family doesnt like me that much. I struggle to make emotional connections with anyone due to my depression and ptsd (family trauma).

I now just live alone, waiting for class to start, eating fish on my bed, staring at the wall, with nothing to do. No hobbies. No interest. No one to be with. Just sitting and waiting until my boyfriend calls.",1628137301.0,1

So about almost 2 months ago I left my masters program. I despised it. It made me upset. I have no passion for school. I dropped it now I'm at square one at home with my parents. And I am now pursuing my acting career that I wanted to pursue for more than a decade now. It's been going quite well to be honest. Since then I've been grinding in the hours I put into my career. Hours of practice and lots of classes. I've been struggling to find jobs though. But I am finally enjoying myself. At last.

It's been two happy months. But a few days ago my depression is creeping back. I am not medically diagnosed and I won't be because I know they'll tell me what I've known since I was 15. I don't want to go on meds. I don't want to go to therapy. I know therapy will work but to be honest I'm just too lazy to go. And the money ugh I won't be able to afford to spend like that. I don't want to burden my parents even though they'll support me 100% financially. 

I have this feeling where I just want to be alone. I don't want to communicate with anyone. I like being around people but only 1 at a time. But when I'm not interested in being around anyone I wish I could disappear from this earth or at least be the only living person on earth. I'm scared of dying but I think of suicide all the time during these phases of my depression. I would never commit it though. It would hurt my mom, dad, and brother. We're a very tight family, the 4 of us. Plus, theres too much to live for. I want to become the actor I know I can be. I want my own kid, wife, house, and just a full life. 

But these terrible thoughts just linger. Even though they do, I'm just so indifferent. It's these feelings of I don't want to feel sad, I don't want to live, I just want to be alone, I wish I could rent a cabin in the woods somewhere take one person I'm close with and sit there in silence. Look at the pretty landscapes. Enjoy life in silence. I know this state I am slowly falling into will pass me by. I'll attend my actors showcase coming up soon. I'll work. And soon enough this process will come by again to say hi. The cycle repeats itself and it'll creep up on me. But I'll keep on living.",1628137268.0,1

They make me feel worse every time I confide in them about my severe depression and anxiety. Is a loving family supposed to be this way? I feel very alone and empty inside. My sister most recently told me that I shouldn't feel ""empty"" because I have family around. How can I keep living if everyone around me is going to blame me for my damn brain chemistry?

This life feels like a dream, all these people around me are just ok with living these sad and boring lives. I am just another person for now and I hate it. I don't fit in with anyone because I don't belong here. Everything around me is wrong, everything is alien to me. I become obsessed with shows and movies because they are where I'm supposed to be. They are so familiar, because that's what my home is like. I feel so connected to those places because those are whats real. This life is terrible.

I'm supposed to live this life and go back when this one is over but I don't want to wait anymore. Its so hard being here. I wish I was never put here. I don't know if this is a punishment or what, but this world is completely wrong. Everything about this place just feels off. Im not insane, I realize how crazy I must seem.

This life doesn't matter, I just have to make it through so that I'm ready to go home. 

This is literally the only explanation for why I feel the way I do. I have lived before, somewhere else, then was born here. This life is like a middle ground. That's why it all feels so worthless, because part of me knows that when this pointless life is over I can finally go home. This isn't my home, these people aren't my family, these people aren't my friends. Maybe for now, maybe to some extent they are. But in the big picture they aren't.

My boyfriend is concerned my depression might get to him,0,oy98iz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy98iz/my_boyfriend_is_concerned_my_depression_might_get/,2,"I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year now. I suffer from anxiety/depression which I am going to therapy for and he's always been super rational and does not suffer from any of this. Because he's never had such experiences, he asks a lot of questions to try to understand and in doing so sets off all of my insecurities about being a difficult person.

We have both had to work on our communication which has had its pros and cons. I am becoming more open to confrontation and he's trying to be more vocal about this affection. But I can't help but worry that we have too many fundamental differences. When we started out, I was handling my depression myself but lately it has gotten a bit worse.

For instance yesterday I couldn't stop crying all day and when he video called me I was just unable to lift my head. He tried to distract me but it wasn't going anywhere so he asked to hang up and I kept crying not exactly wanting him to leave. He still left after a bit saying it didn't seem like him being there was helping. We had an argument about this where I said that, you don't just leave someone mid-cry at the very least. 

We had a whole discussion about him being bad at consoling and he agreed that okay from next time if this happens he gets he needs to stay. But he ended up saying that, he tends to pick up traits of the people he is around and his fear is that if he's too invested in my depression, he will start becoming sad as well, so he's trying to work out a balance.

I understand worrying that taking care of someone else will take over your life, but I feel I'm not asking for that intensity of care either. I mostly handle it myself or vent sometimes and am going to therapy. It's just sometimes it gets out of hand and I expect to get some comfort from my significant other. I think because he has never had any of these experiences he's not able to understand how much work I am putting in to handle it myself, despite trying to explain.

My worry is that my idea of ultimate trust and comfort in a relationship down the line is that I will just be able to open up, vent, cry to my partner when I am having a hard time without worrying, meanwhile I think his fear is that I will do that too much and it will affect him. I feel what is comfort for me might be what is fear for him.

I feel I am trying hard to explain my situation to him and honestly I do feel like he is trying to understand as well but we keep clashing while trying to communicate and I feel it is making my anxiety so much worse. I love him and don't know what I should do.",1628134263.0,1

I often know I'm wrong a lot of the time. Occasionally if I speak up or say something I'm told I'm making too big a deal and need to ""deal with it"". 

I'm tired of being told I'm a failure. I'm suffering but I can't tell anyone. Sometimes they'll start worrying about me if I mention I'm down but then it will inevitably devolve into how it's somehow my fault. Small things like my room being messy or me skipping my exercise routine are treated like I'm a failure of a person. They use that word - failure. And then they get upset when I feel like one.

The loneliness was killing me, I kept going back to my decisions and thinking ""why the fuck did I do that"".

Why could I not even make a simple application, I couldn't even start it, I couldn't even just register an account with my email and password. How could I not even do something as simple as that? I'm so depressed man, I finally admit.

I don't even know where I can find another job now. I graduated University this June and I've been tired ever since. The only jobs opening now from August will be Intaking in September 2022 so this whole year will be wasted.

Ive been feeling like that recently, now that i came to the generalization about gettinf easily influenced and stuff

If i tell myself to be happy, will i really be happy? Ill never know because i dont want to do that

I know very well that i will act on it once i get influenced by something.

Im scared that if i keep telling myself to be happy then i will be happy, because i am that kind of person

I dont want to do that, maybe if i become happy then my depression isnt real then, maybe i deceived people, maybe ive been living a lie, maybe im just a typical teen faking a mental illness for attention.....thats what ive came up with if i became happy.

Starting Effexor,4,oxzkya,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxzkya/starting_effexor/,2,"Some clinical background (tldr at the bottom)

So I’m a 30 year old male and I was diagnosed with clinical depression at age 12. In my pre teen and early teen years I was medicated with Wellbutrin and it was nominally effective. But after I was weened off of it around age 16 I haven’t been medicated again. 

My depression came back with a vengeance around age 17 and since then I have self medicated with cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco (I’m a grown man please don’t lecture me about that part I’m fully aware). It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that I decided to seek professional help and begin treatment of some kind. At that time I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. My doctor decided to tackle the anxiety first, because it is a contributing factor to depression. I’ve been taking Buspar and Propranolol for three months now and it has been noticeably effective at combating my severe anxiety. However, it hasn’t helped my mood and my doctor agreed with my request to try Effexor. 

My question is this- have you tried it? What was your experience? 

I am married to a woman with a very high sex drive and I am concerned about the impact Effexor may have on my libido (and thus our relationship). Have you dealt with this issue?

Hope of Deliverance,1,oy83k9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy83k9/hope_of_deliverance/,0,"Hello, my name is Daniel, and I'm almost 26.. I've got a problem.. I got a problem with myself and my mentality.. for years I have been trying to fix myself, doing up and down, trying to fix myself and trying to find a hope somewhere up there, when you look up in the sky and you should see the clear blue sky but.. in stead I just see the dark and endless black open space. Even on cloudy days, where people try to find the sun, I don't manage to do that. I got several problems with myself, and the first one would be being way too judgmental with myself.. and it's something that's been going on for a very long time. The second problem would be self-hared / disappointment. I'm a guy and I have tried to do stuff for several times ( In regards with girls ) but I always fail. I have let myself and other people down so many times that I have just completely lost my mind and hope.

The only thing I ever wished for was being happy, and being happy is the main goal for at least 100% of the people on this planet. Everyone wants to be happy, doesn't matter if you're a robber, a serial killer, a politician or an hotel manager, we all want to be happy.

And I can't seem to find that G spot of life, being happy. every time I do something it happens with doubt, and with self questions, am I doing it right? What did I do wrong this time? Why can't I be normal like everyone else? and so on.

I don't know what I'm doing here posting this shit, but I have one request to whoever reads it.

I need help. And not the king of help you would expect. I want someone to help me get it over with, finish it, end it, get the job done.

Every minute being alive is like plain pain for me, and I don't like the way I feel and the way I make others feel with my disappointment. Please, if anyone is humane here, help me through what had to be done a long time ago.

I have a video and a WORD file ready on my computer, in case my family or friends find me like this, they'll know a little about my background story, because 99% of the people in my life know nothing about me, it was always hidden, always being put away to make myself seem normal.

I'm sorry if I ever did anything bad to hurt other people, I'm sorry to my family, if they had to deal with my shit. To my friends, who had to try and keep me up and going every time, to my lovers (if I can even call them one) who at least seemed to show some kind of concussion and carness about me.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

For not being good enough for this world, for being unable to cope with whatever is coming towards me, and for letting everyone I know, down.

I hope for the sake of myself and others, that this mistake (of choosing to live any longer and trying to find a hope in this shit life) will not happen again.

If anyone gets this message, for the sake of us all, don't hate me. I hate myself more than you do, you can count on that.

Yours'

I’m not sure what to do,1,oy7vrq,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy7vrq/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,0,"Today just set it off for me. I was doing well for a while. 

Earlier today, my dad came into my room to put up a bookshelf, he did nothing but complain about how my room looked or smelled. 

My sibling yelled at me because I was talking over him on a call with him and our friends but the truth is, I’m half deaf in one ear and he was talking super quiet so I had no idea he was talking at all. He then yelled at me because I “stole his friends” from him and that my friend replaced him with me which I can’t control. He then told our mother who got mad at me. He is also abusive to me. I got a lock on my door to protect myself from him. He has tried to pick that lock, break down my door, and thrown stuff at it. He gets mad that I “don’t use his preferred name” when he switches it daily and doesn’t bother telling me. I’ve had bruises from him, my mom has had black eyes and bite marks, my dad almost had his finger bitten off, and my grandma almost got stabbed in the head with a pen by him. (Not today but multiple times in the past few years.)

My hamster got out of his cage and I had to run on a wild goose chase to try and find him. I messed up my room more than it was in the process of finding him and now I have to clean it just to make it usable and I have breathing issues so that’s going to make it even more difficult than it was going to be. 

I have health issues including low blood sugar, anemia and hypoglycemia. On top of that, I have fast metabolism so no matter how much I eat, I can’t gain weight. I’m 89 pounds (about 40kg). I should weigh a lot more than I do. 

My parents always play the victim when I try to talk to them about how I feel. Ex: “Am I just a bad parent? You have everything you want.” If my sibling hits me and I hit back, I’m the bad guy because I “should know better”. Last time I talked to them about it, I ended up crying and we were all yelling and I got sent to my room, followed by texts from both my parents including how I’m “overreacting” or “making too big of a deal out of it”.

I’m transgender as well and have been bullied countless times for that. I’ve been called a queer, a f@ggot, a tr4nny, it, and a girl. I was also told to kms. My pronouns are specifically he/they. 

I was bullied my entire life even before I came out. Now, one of my childhood bullies is in my school. My friends always say they would protect me from her but I highly doubt that. There was this “incident” I guess I should call it where I was told I told two people to off themselves in a call in late December. I had not done that nor been on a call with them until February the next year. I was called names by one of my “friends” who defended the two boys and later unfriended me. The two boys who I apparently told to “off themselves” turned everyone against me. I cried for a while and was suicidal.

My grades were really bad that year and I somehow made it through to the end of year. My grades went up to pretty okay by last June.

In elementary when I was being bullied, I had one friend. He passed away that year at 6 years old from heart disease and his birthday was three days ago. I had a friend in fourth grade who ended up moving away. 

I hit high school and everything seemed okay with me finally being who I am and being able to make some good friends. The only issue is, I am somehow physically unable to cry. I don’t know why. It could be my Zoloft that I’m on (anti-depressant) but I’m really not sure. 

I’m an insomniac as well so I can never get good sleep. It’s currently 22:00 (10pm) and I still need to finish cleaning my room. I usually go to bed by 2 maybe 4am. 

My favorite teacher was fired as well.

I feel my girlfriend might be upset with me for some reason and I’m scared she might want to break up.

I am just such a mess right now. I’m not sure what to do at the moment. Sorry I went on such a rant of my life story. I just need support. I know I might face some transphobia/homophobia following this post but I’m honestly used to that by now.

My story,1,oy7rjs,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy7rjs/my_story/,1,I think sharing my story will help me find closure. I’m here to do something anyway. I have been struggling with intense depression and anxiety since freshman year of high school. I’ve hid it from my family and most of my friends. I’ve tried drugs and therapy but I hated it all. I’m 23 now I’m an engineer.  I have every blessing I could hope for but I feel like I take it for granted no matter how hard I try to be thankful I’d much rather kill myself or something. My family split up so I lived alone majority of high school resenting everyone. Even my friends I grew distant. I opened up to someone senior year and grew co dependent on her. I had no one else in my eyes. Even if it wasn’t true it didn’t feel right. We eventually cut ties after a long time for both our mental health’s. I was to much of a bother and She wasn’t who I needed in my life. Ever since I’ve been coasting through panic attacks and depression. Just living. It feels like a pain.  Eventually I felt the world grew gray and I didn’t wanna die anymore. What purpose is it for me to kill myself. I don’t even care if I do or don’t. If the option was laid before me I’d take it.  Shit I tried to give myself chlorine poisoning at some point. It was painful. After just nothing but shit in my life I met someone. That I grew to really like she was great she supported me even after I told her my story. But thats just what I thought. It was just another person trying to pass time to them it feels like I feel like I grew attached again we broke things off and here I am. I feel lost Incomplete and unnoticed. Even when I try to reach out I’m met with silence. I’m not suicidal. The pain of this is probably the worst I’ve felt in a long time. To feel like the one person who truly understood me. And said so much to me and promised me. And to get no reason why but to feel like nothing more than a toy to the person I trusted. It just made my feelings on it all come back. And I did snap on them and I tried to apologize for it but nothing happens but silence. That’s my story so far. I skipped a lot but it’s where I am.,1628128926.0,1

I’ve just ended my second marriage (after breaking up for a year and trying again). This marriage, as well as my first, was toxic and abusive. Mostly emotionally, but physically in both.

I know that leaving was the right decision. But, my worst fear in life is being realized- ending up alone. I don’t mean in the sense of being single; although, as terrible as he was at times, it’s just nice to have someone familiar to come home to, to talk to, to sleep next to. Something that, when things were good, felt like home. Now, I come home and the house is empty and quiet. Full of dead memories and haunting silence.

I don’t want to date again, because I’m afraid of ending up with another toxic man. The only living members of my family are my mom and brother, whom I rarely speak to, and they live in another state.

I don’t really have friends, because it was always so difficult to make them or keep them due to his jealousy and control. As of right now, my depression is active and so is my anxiety because this is a very traumatic situation for me to be in. So, I don’t see myself getting out much to feel less alone. Home doesn’t feel like home, I feel like I was dropped off somewhere and abandoned. 

The world is a scary place right now, I don’t feel safe going out alone or meeting people online, so I don’t know what to do. 

I’m to the point where I’m not thinking about doing anything stupid, but that I am not sure I want to live the rest of my life like this- alone and unable to do anything about it.

It’s been 7 years, meaning technically i have 2 years left. That year was really bad for me. I remembered abuse I’d repressed for 10+ years and attempted suicide. I was insanely lonely. I lived in a foreign country (wasn’t my first, we moved all the time, we kept moving after that too) and my class was very small. Give or take 30 people in my entire high school. 12 of them in my grade, we all knew and studied English but during breaks no one spoke it. No one spoke to me regularly. I took a week off from school after my attempt. When I came back, my homeroom teacher (really really nice man. i wish i told him how much i appreciate him) made a comment about my absence - he asked my classmate nearby and she said she never noticed I was gone. Didnt notice I was gone in a high school of 30 people. 

Since that year I moved 3 times. I’ve been really lonely and I don’t try as much to make friends (90% are online). 2 and a half months before my 18th birthday my mom died. She was abusive, and didnt take care of her illness, so I had to look after her during emergencies as young as 5.

Since then things have gone from bad to worse. 

Now, I’m 22, in a major I feel unsure in (my second lol, I switched a year ago), still very friendless, and at my very very lowest. Lower than when I attempted. 

Since October I lost 50 pounds, but my body is flabby and I experienced a kidney infection and possible nerve damage. Covid has triggered my eating disorder (it was always present but never to the level of a 50 pound loss). I’m not upset about the weight loss, if anything I want to go below my current BMI of 20. I relapsed and self harmed, my biggest scar to date, although I havent done so in a few months. The urges are coming back though lmao wonder why.

I very nearly failed uni this summer. and despite having almost no irl friends, I still manage to ruin relationships around me. I used to think I was a good person as a kid but really I’ve blossomed into a horrible subcategory of a human. 

I just feel like I’m running out of time and that it will only keep getting worse. I’m pretty sure I have a personality disorder but throughout my life both my family and MH professionals have disregarded my words and told me that I am “a hormonal teenage girl”. I’m upset bc if this had been taken care of it woukdnt have festered like  this.

I just don't know anymore. I've been fighting this battle for 20 something years now and sometimes I don't know why. I was a pretty happy kid but somewhere in my 20s things changed. As I once described it to my wife, it was a dark cloud that would sit over me for days and days. I wouldn't go anywhere or talk to anyone, just slept and operated like some kind of zombie. Once I met my wife 2006, it all faded away and I was astonished. Was it that easy? 2011 was a bad year, she cheated on me. I lost weight, couldn't sleep, worried and cried all the time. We separated and it was during this time that I realized I needed to see a therapist. She suggested more sessions but I only wanted something so I could go to sleep. Depression runs in the fam so there was no doubt that I had went undiagnosed but I didn't want to be on pills. We reconciled and things were good for a while but slowly the cloud came back and it was difficult to put up a front for them. Now that we have 2 girls, I cannot bear the thought of hurting them but how does one continue on feeling this way? I don't wanna drink or do drugs to numb the pain, and I don't want to take meds because I don't want to be labeled in any way. It's not my fault that I feel like this.

Resources for people supporting a depressed partner.,19,oxp9na,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxp9na/resources_for_people_supporting_a_depressed/,12,"Hi /r/depression

My partner suffers from depression and recently decided to ramp down and off medication from heavy episode of depression last year.

My partner is stable but now hovering along the lines of bad/negative mood often. It’s wearing me down to be around self-hate and negativity.

I was thinking of suggesting couples therapy but I’m afraid that will spiral my partner. I also don’t know how to suggest it without triggering abandonment fears.

I could use some resources or tips for support partners struggling to manage in a situation where we’re both at home together constantly.

I’ll delete if this is the wrong place to ask this.

Thanks.",1628070558.0,1

Hesitant to try SSRI's again but don't know what else to do,3,oxyqdx,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxyqdx/hesitant_to_try_ssris_again_but_dont_know_what/,5,"Hi, I've never posted before so I apologize for any typos or unclear information. For some background, I (24f) have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 9, which was when both my parents were imprisoned. I've been in therapy often, but mostly through college and graduate school. I tried taking an SSRI my first year of graduate school but gave up since it made me more depressed and anxious (I think I may have been too hasty but I was not thinking clearly at the time, and I needed to pass my classes).

Lately I have been feeling myself slip back into this depressive ""cloud"" and I can't for the life of me find any motivation or drive to do what I need to do to go back to my confident, content self. It interferes with my research constantly, and often puts a strain in my relationship. I'm in therapy again but it doesn't feel like it's helping much. I feel like two completely different people constantly battling for control in my head.

Here's why I am hesitant to try another SSRI: After my parent's arrest my brother and I were sent to live with my grandparents, and growing up I watched my grandmother take an SSRI for depression and anxiety but never work towards dealing with the actual root of the problem. She is still taking them to this day but has never really improved since she's just masking some of her symptoms. I don't want to start taking medication and then think I'm fine and stop working towards bettering myself. I'm mainly concerned with this because I tend to ignore my symptoms anyways, so I'm worried I would continue that trend even on meds. Also it takes a lot of time before it's apparent if an SSRI is working, and the weeks after starting or stopping one can be very emotionally draining. I don't feel like I have time to spend searching for the right medication while also maintaining my graduate research.

Has anyone else been through something similar? I guess I'm wondering if it is worth all the trouble to find the right medication and if others have found it difficult to stop even with therapy.",1628100933.0,1

I am overweight (125kg, 190cm) have no friends, no girlfriend. I would love to have a gf, but im shy and afraid to talk to them because i think they automatically dont like me. It takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep because i keep thinking about my old classmate (20F). 

We went to school together for 9 years. After we graduated, we still went out with our group (2girls, 6 boys) for like a year or so. After falling and breaking my leg, i decided not to go out with them until my leg had healed completely. I had cast on leg for month and couldnt walk without crutch for another month.

One boy kicked me and another guy from the groupchat we had because we stopped going out with them. After that i havent talked with that girl since 2017 july. Recently i started seeing that 1 girl in large store working as cashier and i just cannot get her out of my head. I keep thinking about her, but im afraid to do anything

Future planning when you can’t see a future,1,oy4you,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy4you/future_planning_when_you_cant_see_a_future/,1,"So today it was dropped on me that I need to plan to move out of where I’m living as my housemates who own the house want to sell and buy a new place for their future together. 

Some background - my best friend and her partner, also my very close friend live together and in January of this year I found myself having to move out of where I lived and not knowing where to go. They said I could live with them for as long as I needed and so I moved in. I am disabled and because of that I do not work and am on benefits. I pay rent but it is only what I can afford not what it should actually be. They both make good money and have a good lifestyle that I kinda tag along in by default and I’m super appreciative of that. 

So today BF said to me that they were talking and they want to sell and buy somewhere for them, and they are starting to plan their future together/ long term working from home arrangements and possibly kids. She wants at least a month with me out so she can arrange the house for selling and she wants to have moved by (I think she said) March next year. 

I understand all that, I really do. But I am still a little hurt, feel a little rejected, a little betrayed. I wish they had not said for me to move in with them in the first place as then I wouldn’t be looking to move again right now. 

They want to support me, help me plan, do whatever to help me work out what I’m going to do. She offered me to not pay rent so I can save some money for a deposit, as I have no savings. But it seems pointless as then what, I’ll have a deposit to live somewhere I can’t afford long term? Also I’ll feel like a charity case. 

Anyway, I’m really depressed atm anyway and have been struggling with wanting to unalive myself, but now I have to plan for a future I’m not even sure I want? Idk what to do. 

I think I want to move far away, maybe by the coast in the north where money goes further. But maybe that’s just me trying to run away. 

Any tips on what I should do? Other than you know, unalive myself which looks more attractive by the hour.",1628119224.0,1

But it's available. I know that much. I can even buy it on Ebay and have it shipped to my home in 4 days. So I have to stop and think, this is it. This is where rubber meets road.

One way or the other. Either you let me end my life peacefully, or you let me live it peacefully. No ifs, ands or buts. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of always having to fight you. I'm tired of how utterly helpless you make me feel. How fucking worthless I am because of your words, bleeding into my head.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few months now. And I recently had a bit of a wake up call and started to be proactive about it. I hit what I thought was rock bottom. And I decided I wanted to be happy again. So I’ve bought books, started going to counselling, started taking medication, got back into exercise, I was really trying. I really wanted to get back to being the person I know I am inside. 

But today she told me I’m not enough. The changes I have made aren’t enough. She doesn’t think the future I can offer would be happy enough. 

I know I shouldn’t define my self worth on someone’s opinion. But when you love someone as much as I love her, hearing them tell you all the progress you’ve been making isn’t enough… I am shattered. 

If the person who knows me best on this earth, who has been there for all my highs and lows, if she is looking at me and has decided I can’t be happy enough, why should I keep trying? She knows me better than anyone. I gave her my everything. 

I thought I’d hit rock bottom before I started trying to get better. But now I know what rock bottom actually feels like. 

It’s trying your absolute best. Giving something everything you have. Committing 110% towards a goal. 

To stand in front of a person who is your whole world and be told you are not enough. You are not the choice. You are a shadow to the person who is your sun.

So, there's the bad, the good and the ugly: Sometimes I enter in reddits like those to feel better about myself. Even more, when we are talking about relationships. I'm a 21, soon to be 22 years woman. Most of the time, I still feel like a girl. I had only two relationships on my life, one was terrible, the other was me using a person to cope with my own problems.

I see everyone having their life set. I see everyone finding someone. But I just can't. I don't find anyone to connect to, the person I like is currently dating someone else. Ar the same time, I wait for them to be over, but I feel terrible for doing it because he's my friend. At the same time, I wish that he'll be happy with her, I want him to have good memories.

I see everyone my own age going out and dating and doing stuff. I know that the reason that I don't do it, it's because of myself. I'm a person who enjoys being alone, I isolate myself and refuse to use apps like tinder, I got off of social media, because I was stalking people (something that I hate doing) and because it gave me a absurd amount of anxiety. I feel terrible because I have this urge to be with someone, but I know it's something that I want to do because it's what should be considered normal.

And I Just can't. I'm confused. I feel terrible because I feel that I have no solution.

The nice part is, at least I have my animal crossing villagers, they seem to be always happy to have me around.

I'm in a really bad hole right now. I had a fight with my stepmom, one of hundreds we've had in my life. To put it short, she was extremely emotionally and mentally abusive to me growing up (she came into my life when I was 7, I'm 23 now). She said a lot of fucked up stuff to me as a kid. Things that still fuck with me, and have probably contributed to my lack of commitment/trust with people. 

I brought up a thing she said to me years ago. She told me, as I was on my way out the door on my way to school, trying to escape an argument, ""You'll be the reason your dad and I ever break up."" I didn't really get it at the time, besides getting the message that I was unwanted. That feeling has followed me through my entire life. So I brought it up to her just an hour ago. She vehemently denied that she would ever have said that to me, and said ""how dare you accuse me of that"". Then stormed out of my room eluding to me needing help for my mental health and that I made it all up. 

This is the closest I've been to crying in probably a year, since my last mental breakdown that had me screaming at somebody that I wanted to die (that's another issue, I'm pretty fucked up and definitely need therapy.) I'm still not *able to* cry, but I feel really shitty right now. And now I'm wondering if it really was something she said, or if my brain is just so messed up that I fabricated it all. I would believe that if it weren't for the fact that there are multiple different instances of shit like that happening that I remember vividly. 

Anyway, I feel like a waste of breath right now and don't have the mental energy to even go back to my new job tomorrow.

Basically I feel like I've wasted 9 years of my life. I'm too ashamed to bring up my age so I won't. Either way I have nothing to show for for my life. My grandmother became a Foster Parent. I was okay with it, figured it would be great to teach someone. At that time I was working on my GED. I didn't waste my time with drugs or drinking I was .. pretty straight edged. Always listened, followed my curfew, just did what I was told and kept my head in the books. I never had that much of a relationship with my grandmother but I always wanted her to be happy. Lets just say I put aside my GED to help her with the kids. She asked and needed help around the house and eventually I became a backup-Foster Parent. Many different children passed through our home, we even adopted one. But I hate how my life has become. I've not had a relationship, hell I'm scared of rejection. I've never had a serious job, I've babysat, done computer and bike repair, taught some people how to do art for money and such but I've never had a part-time or full-time. I've had chances like cleaning cars but she thought that was below me so I never pursued that. Here I am though at a much older age looking at my life and... I have a roof over my head. My finances aren't what they should be but I'm not poor. My health is okay even if I'm slightly overweight but... success. I don't have it. I regret spending so long teaching kids and taking care of them and I feel like my life has withered away. I feel like I should of reached success by now, the thought of redoing school after 9 years sickens me. I know I've grown lazy or complacent. I wonder what would happen if she died... what would happen to me. Someone who's only knowledge is early highschool, teaching myself about computers and having no social or job experience. I never thought I'd grow up to feel like a bum. In school I was somewhat oddly popular. I was the goth kid and the class clown at times but my grades weren't horrible. I was shy I never spoke unless someone spoke to me first but I loved talking to people... I don't know what to do but figured I'd let it all out.

I want to learn a new hobby but guess what, I can't do it at home. I want to just go grab a cup of coffee in peace but the fear of being positive makes me anxious.

6 months ago, my grandma's sister died of covid, and just 2 nights ago, my cousin's grandpa also died due to covid with my cousins, aunt, uncle and their grandma positive with covid. My mom also has to isolate at home because she was in direct contact with her coworker who was positive with covid.

I'm not feeling well myself but it's mostly because of overwork and it irks me thinking that my grandma here at home (not the same grandma who is positive with covid) kept visiting my mom in her room. Yeah, she got vaccinated but I haven't had my full vaccination yet and my younger sister is not yet vaccinated and I kept thinking how irresponsible it is on her part.

Then, I began thinking how I don't have anything to live for and if I do die anytime this year, I  might cry on my deathbed but then again, I'd be reminded how useless my life is and I think I'll die in peace.

TL;DR Started feeling depressed at 4, got worse and worse for a couple years, but then I started to feel okay for a little while and now I'm feeling worse than ever before.. Would love some help or tips to get by easier!

So... I started feeling kind of depressed with anxiety attacks here and there at the age of about 14, honestly don't even know why...

Then about a year later I realized why, existential crisis. I struggled for about 4 years with that and never really came to a conclusion of stuff like: why do we exist; why are the time we spend here fleeting and irrelevant; what's the point of even living this pointless existence when whatever we do we can't avoid the unavoidable death. I just couldn't find any happiness anymore, it was like I was dead inside... Sure, some very temporary moments made me laugh but it wasn't happiness really. I even tried overdosing(but my friends managed to stop me), I tried to slit my wrist but didn't get deep enough.

At the age of about 18 I started doing drugs, and that ""helped"" as a temporary solution for about 6 years. But then I was required to stop for various reasons. And when I got sober, ALL of those previous depression reasons hit me like a train and I fell so deep in to that ""hole"" that I just couldn't ever possibly see myself getting out.

But then a bit over half a year ago I came to the conclusion that: yes althought it might be pointless in the end, life is fleeting and precious, we only got one chance at doing the best of our lifes. After that I have been feeling pretty okay, but all those thoughts have still been gnawing at me in the back my head.

And that brings us to today, as I said I had been feeling okay. But then for some reason EVERYTHING just crashing down on me... Sure I have been having fun writing my own programs, sure I have been able to enjoy movies/shows, sure I love cooking food and playing games.

But it just does not fucking matter, no matter what I do, nor anyone else for that matter. Heat death will cause ALL life, and it's creations, to not matter... At all... No matter how you look at it, everything is pointless, not matters...

Venting,1,oy3w1x,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oy3w1x/venting/,1,"  Where do I even start? I grew up with my father not being present to just becoming straight up abusive. My mother went from caring and protective, to a woman who seemed dead inside who is just starting to come back to life after much therapy. I've had thousands of dollars stolen or just taken from me by them. I was broke the entire time, emotionally abused, abandoned, and beaten. I left home at eighteen to go live with another family. Came out as a trans woman then had to go move to bum fuck Florida after their marriage blew the hell up. The new families husband wound up being emotionally abusive toward me so I had to cut him off entirely. Then the wife of the new family became emotionally and I'm now thinking I might have to cut her out. 

 I moved to Richmond and am at VCU in some kind of attempt to maybe live a semi successful life, but I'm border line failing my classes due to having no meds, no insurance, and just being dumb as hell,  so now I am desperately trying to find a trans friendly doctor in Richmond, and I'm just scared and alone, and don't want to go back to moving around and fuck. Just fuck. 

  I'm trying my best with summer school, but everything is moving so fast, and I can't keep up when all I want to do is curl up in a ball and just stem and cry myself to sleep.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Sometimes it feels like I'm drowning in my own self-destructive thoughts. Endless self-sabotage despite trying my best to get a grip on the little sanity I have left. It sucks and I wish it would just stop.

It’s been ups and downs for years now and I‘ve been on Sertraline for a long time but now, after a first psychiatrist‘s appointment in a really long time, I‘ve been given the option to switch from Sertraline to Venflaxine. The Sertraline helped to some extent, I don’t SH anymore, back when I started it I noticed an improvement but it’s just… anti-climactic, especially after all these years. It‘s like I‘m still depressed, it‘s just harder to feel it, if that makes sense.

I was a competitive swimmer and I had qualified for Olympic trials so losing this was basically like losing everything I had worked for my entire life. Needless to say my depression and suicidal thoughts got worse until the only time I felt okay was with my best friend. Over the year I started to get into a worse and worse mental state and I guess I became hard to be around or something. Anyways my best friend stopped hanging out with me after Christmas out of nowhere without rly saying anything. I asked to hangout multiple times a week and I know she was busy but it seemed like she never had time for me anymore. Anyways a few weeks ago she told me that our friendship was one sided and that she didn’t want to talk to me as much. I try to ask her if she wants to do stuff and she always just says I’ll let you know and then just never brings it up again. I really don’t want to lose her as a friend she is literally the only thing I have left and she means the world to me.

To the point where I wasn't in contact with many people, I contracted COVID and was very sick, I had my mother to take care of me, oh yeah also at 33 I had to move back becuase u lost my job.

I realised I had barely anyone to tell I was sick, barley anyone asking if I was ok, all these years and I haven't managed to build a network that cared about me. No one checking up on me but my mom and brother, there was a night I felt like I am dying, I couldn't breathe. And it wouldnt matter much, 

My ex wife who I have beautiful children with, we keep breaking up and getting back together in a toxic cycle where she tells me what a piece of shit I am but then when I leave she blames me for ""breaking up the family"" she also keeps me from making friends with jealousy.

I realised I could just die, everyday my body is decaying, I've applied for so many jobs, and I have gotten 8 interviews and haven't landed a single one. Before Zoom interviews I've landed every single one of my jobs, but post that in Zoom I can't land any, after the interview I just don't hear back.

Also, my parents are, are getting rid of this house and moving abroad in a few months and Literally don't have a single cent and with my Ex wife asking me to get back and move back with the family is my only option, but I know she will start treating my like shit in a few days, her making all the money and paying for everything while I have nothing. 

And to be honest I don't even blame her for it becuase I don't offer anything as a man.

The only reason I don't kill myself is becuase, I don't want to put my kids through that, my 14 year old doesn't talk to anyone he's always either gaming or ignoring everyone, he goes to sleep at 2am and even though I've spoken to my ex about she told me she makes the money so she will parent. I get no respect from the kids. Although my 8 year old has a very good relationship with me and looks up to me.

I don't think I've been such a bad guy in life I have ADHD I struggle with work and remembering things, but I'm not an asshole and always try my best but it's never good enough.

I am also suffering from what I believe to be long haul covid symptoms, I am very tired, even more than normal, I am trying to wake up early but mid day I fall asleep and then sleep most of the night, my lungs and breathing is so bad that I can't even run or work out like I used to to improve mood.

I am mentally and physically exhausted, I am broke, I am lonely, I am rejected by job after job, and my ex/partner treats me like shit, but also is the only one sending me money and doing things to help me so that even makes me feel worse.

In top of that I just know traumatic experiences are waiting for me, my grandmother parents, and aunts who I am fairly close with will die, and these are just trauma incidents waiting for me. Even if I dig myself out of this episode, I most likely there will just be more episodes in the future becuase I always fuck up anyway.

Even if I get a job and leave my ex, I will have to deal with not seeing my kids, she is very smart, savvy and manipulative, I can't win against her, I will see my kids with a stepdad and it will be a reminder of what I failure I am and how I couldn't keep my family together becuase I'm a loser.

My brother age 18 is also off to study in the U.S my stepdad an American Citizen who married my mom when I was 15 could have submitted some forms which would have given me access to the US but it has to be done before you are 18 and he didn't do it for me even though I begged them to do it, I had a chance to live in the U.S to get opportunities as apposed to South Africa with the high crime and lack of jobs but he couldn't do a simple form.

He calls my brother everyday and tell him he loves which he didn't do for me, he took my brother to tour England and the U.S and I have never left the country. He is making sure his son gets every opportunity but always got mad whenever my mom did something for me and my education and none of this ever gets talked about I have to smile like nothing happened.

My dad also didn't pay attention to me and went on having his own family even though I enjoyed being around him, his personality and so on.

When I have arguments with my ex wife she also reminds me that my father or stepfather doesn't love me or want my becuase of ""the type of person I am""

ive always been kind of a sad person in general due to mistreatment at home  and i lived with my stepdad who could honestly probably give 2 shits about me but around 14 my mom started using drugs and it really started effecting her like alot... she slowly started losing her mind so we decided to move across the country (closer to my stepdads family) i only got a weeks notice to prepare myself to move out of a place ive lived for my whole life, everything i knew was from my small hometown.. so i had to say goodbye to everyone i knew in a one week span , fast forward to when we finally moved, the first few months we were living with my stepdads mom and stepdad in a 2 bedroom house (we had a family of 5 plus my step dads mom her bf) this did not help the situation with my mom at all she would sit up at night and start talking to herself laughing at absolutely nothing, this definitely did not help my mental state either i was honestly already super depressed but i didnt want to show it to my mom for the sake of her mentality, fast forward again and we get our own house finally and my mom is still getting worse to the point she says she talked to lucifer and stuff and my little sisters were scared of her, especially because my mom was convinced we (me and my siblings) were hacking her phone and putting cameras in the tvs. we tried and tried to make her go get help but she just swore up and down we were out to get her. it was to the point every single night would end in a screaming match with someone in the family, i remember one thing that fucked me up and still really really hurts me is when she said once i turn 18 she doesn't wanna talk to me anymore... so while all this is happening at home its making me so physically and emotionally drained i just didnt have the energy to try in school or even make friends. so after about a year or so of being across the country i couldnt handle being in that house anymore so i moved back with one of my close friends in my original hometown, everything was going ""fine"" until i met this girl (at the time ive never really got into a serious serious commitment) we started talking and had mutual feelings for each other so we started dating, i regret ever doing that she was my 1st true love and she made me care for her alot and made me fall hard only for her to cheat on me not once but 2 times this literally broke me and to this day still haven't even fully recovered, we were together for nearing a year (we did take a break when i found out she was cheating and for some reason blinded by love i got back with her) she found a new guy within about a week and i was once again left alone only having my like 3 friends for support only to get extremely sick and have to miss a week of school straight which ended up making the truant show up at my house and tell me i NEED to go to school (i was a junior) so the next day i went and the teachers sent me to the nurses because i was shaking and trembling during my whole 1st 2nd and 3rd period classes the nurse took my temperature and it was 106 if i remember right which made her start freaking out and they ended up calling the e.r and in all the commotion the school was looking through my files to contact someone and they noticed i did not live with my mom so about 4 days later she comes to my house again and basically tells me im kicked out of the school and i have to go back across the country to live with my mom, this once again really messed me up, i ended up living with my grandma who wasnt too far out of my original hometown so i lived there for about a year or 2 but right before i turned 18 i was randomly kicked out still dont know why but this is where thing really started to go downhill i moved out and was homeless for 2 years switching between my 2 friends houses and staying to avoid sleeping on the streets (crime is really high in my town)  all while all this is happening my mom split up with my stepdad (who she was with my whole life)and moved back in with her dad who wasnt the greatest person to deal with my mom at this point she already had been diagnosed with schizophrenia eventually they got tired of dealing with her so she got kicked out and somehow got the money to move back to visit my sister but my stepdad didnt let her back in and now she too was homeless and at a womans homeless shelter i tried staying in contact with her but it really just hurt to she was a completly different person it was like the person i was talking to wasnt even my mom just a stranger that took my moms body ,she would always ask if i had spare money which i didnt i was flat broke i could barley even get food to eat ,at one point i was around 80 pounds ... do you know how bad it hurts when you cant even help your mom let alone help yourself? (she still asks every now and then but even today im not in a great situation) so my mom just slowly off the grid only messaging me on facebook like once every couple months and moving all over the country which made me worried sick , but after the 2 years i was homeless and i finally got a job with my friend and got my own place with him , it was a very very old trailer and was falling apart but it felt good actually having my own place to stay and not feel like a complete bum. stayed there for about another year and i dont wanna get to into detail but someone else moved in as well and made us both move out , so there i was 19 and homeless once again and i still had no car or license, i was really done trying with everything everyday i woke up wanting to die.. i even tried multiple times but backed out cause i was too scared of making my mom anymore depressed than she was so i kept going so about a month or 2 later we got another place to stay which is the place im at now , i was honestly slowly getting better and trying to be a better person until just recently ... so one of my friends that i stayed with when i was homless has had just as a shitty life as mine if not worse so we were very very close he was like a brother to me , he ended up getting really sick with chron's disease which made him lose a ton of weight (for those who dont know Chron's is a inflammatory bowel disease which heavily affects your diet) he was in and out of the hospital for awhile, i let him stay with me for a few weeks cause he was living with his grandma which was not the best for someone in his condition. everything was fine for the first 2 weeks until one week he started uncontrollably vomiting and would not eat so he would only be awake about 2 hours everyday he ended up going back and later that night got life flighted ..... the hospital he was flighted to was said to be one of the best of the state but apparently they kept overfilling him with fluids.... so he was there for about 2 days until i gotta call from a mutual best friend of mine and his .... he passed due to complete organ faliure due to an infection which couldve easily been prevented.... This was only about 4 days ago i got this news... i dont even know how to handle anything anymore i feel so alone.. he was one of my only friends i could open up to.... i went through so much with him and just like that he was gone... last thing i even said to him was he needs to eat and take his medication...i didnt even get to tell him i loved him.... my mind is always overthinking... my soul is empty... my heart is heavy... i dont see a reason to even keep going",1628054535.0,1

I can maintain my part time job, and fake smile to my kids and strangers because I have to, and I don't want to get anyone down if they were to really know how far in despair I am.

But once the kids are in bed I'm so exhausted from pretending all day, I just lay in bed either drinking because I need to quiet my thoughts, or when I can fight the drinking I'm stuck in my own head imagining the best way to commit suicide. By now I've written each of my children a letter, and last night I wrote my husband a letter. That was the last suicide note I still needed to write.

Lately I've been thinking of specific dates I would do it on. Once we've taken the kids to their last snow trip. I just can't keep doing this anymore, but I know it would hurt them so much.

I guess I want to know if this is a common occurrence and why so much worse at night? Thanks for reading the novel.

I met a girl in my school and fall in love deeply. I wasn't the type that fall in love easily but when I do, i really do. We were close for years doing everything together like studying, going home and many activities. Sadly, i was just treated as a close friend. I was okay but i was not able to let go of her but instead i kept trying. 

My life have been tough due to my intership and many problems i am facing which make me constantly upset. But i'm thakful to have her by myside supporting me through difficult phase of life. 

One day i found out that she was using  a dating app trying to find a boyfriend. I was deeply affected because this was all along behind my back. Although i'm not his boyfriend to say anything but i really care for her and I just can't bare to let her go because i really do love her. Because of this i became very depressed. Some people thinks that it's stupid to be depressed over a girl but i just can't help myself no matter what i do. I just can't help but to think about killing myself every single day.

I feel broken,2,oxr9ok,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxr9ok/i_feel_broken/,1,"First time ever writing my feelings down so please bare with me, I hope it makes sense! I don't even know where to start but I will try.

Since I was a teenager I felt different. I was very quiet and had low confidence. I had plenty of friends but always felt like the odd one out, I drank alcohol (alot) to mask my sadness. When I was 20, my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me. It was really hard (my first heartbreak) but what I wasn't prepared for was when he left me so did most of my friends. You see he was a popular guy and girls wanted to be around him. I was too quiet and embarrassed to say anything, it made me feel worthless. It didn't seem to matter that these people had been my friends for 10 years! I became more isolated, I still had a couple of friends but never felt good enough. I increased my drinking to make me feel better. Started seeing guy after guy, not always sexual but there are a few regrets I won't lie. In the meantime I couldn't hold a job, I never felt good enough and I felt it got in the way of my drinking. I didn't go to college because I thought I wasn't smart enough. I was arguing with my parents alot because of my excessive drinking. I was extremely depressed but told nobody.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 25 I was still the same, going nowhere in life.. gaining weight, can't drive, can't hold a job, no college education, still drinking, still living with my parents. All because I felt I was not good enough for this world. I was in the absolute pits of hell it felt like. Fighting every single day against a demon inside my head telling me all of these negative things about myself. One day I eventually broke down and told my parents how I was actually feeling and why I was like this. They were shocked (I covered my sadness well) I could actually feel the weight had been lifted. I went to the doctor, started medication and counselling.  All was going quite well I felt I was getting stronger. I started a job in an office in a school. That is where I met my boyfriend (he is a teacher).

&#x200B;

I was on cloud nine. I knew from the first few dates that he was my soulmate and I would be with him forever. I could gush about what a wonderful person he is but I will spare ye!! Over the next few years I was happier than ever loving my life with him. I was working in a new job, did a college course, I was still drinking but not as much.

&#x200B;

But it was too good to be true. The inner voice came back telling me I wasn't good enough. My parents and boyfriend would be better off without me. I was very suicidal and wrote my letters explaining my decision to them. Thankfully I broke down one night and told my boyfriend and with my parents help they all rallied around and tried to get me better again. It has been working on and off.

&#x200B;

I hate myself right now. I feel like I am going backwards.

If I write it all down I am a very lucky person on paper:

&#x200B;

My boyfriend proposed 5 weeks ago. We are getting married in 2023.

We are in the middle of building our forever home. We hope to be moved in next year!

My parents are very supportive of me and allowing me and boyfriend to live with them while we save money for our house.

I have 3 best friends who never left my side through all my depression and drinking.

I have a good job in a hospital.

I have just finished a course in Mental Health and would love to pursue counselling in young people.

I did a charity skydive this year and raised money for a mental health charity.

I gave up drinking one year ago and it improved my life and relationships with everyone drastically.

I still don't drive but I know I need to soon as my new home will be in the countryside! (driving gives me huge anxiety, I feel sick just typing about it)

&#x200B;

I have come such a long way!! I am 30 now. Yet here I am at 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon lying in bed (when I should be at work) crying my eyes out because I think everyone deserves better than me. I feel like I am not good enough and I want to die! whhhyyyyy does this never go away!! I feel like I am always going to be sick and no matter how much I fight against it and try to live a good life, that voice in mind just drags me back down again and again. I can feel I am losing the energy to fight this. I am such a burden and I feel so terrible for worrying the people in my life. I hate myself.",1628078811.0,1

It's like falling eternally into the void. There is no point, no meaning in anything. It's not that nothing can make me happy anymore. Nothing matters.

There is no solution, no explanation. Just random events without a reason and we think that we have a choice. That emotions can be controlled. That soul can be fixed.

Is something beyond depression and and any other mental disorder, is the realization that nothing will never change. People, animals will suffer and living pointless lives until they random death. There is no way to make myself to become ignorant again so there is no joy anymore. Never was here it was just an illusion. 

The darkness has taken me completely. Maybe there was a chance to be saved some months ago but it's just late, nobody tried. That's OK maybe it was meant to be this way. I hope everything to end soon even if I secretly wish for a miracle. But miracles don't exist the harsh reality.",1628057041.0,1

And yesterday, 5 days later, it hit me like a truck. Nausea, sadness, crying spell and headache. My boyfriend did not understand where all this is coming from.

I don’t shower. I don’t brush my teeth. I wear the same cloths for weeks on end.

Then I eat more unhealthy food and sleep as much as I can and repeat the cycle in another few days. In a strange way I seem to put vast amounts of effort into being extremely lazy. I fear everything and find happiness in nothing. I neglect to take care of my basic human needs while striving with my whole soul silence the ever looming negative, self loathing thoughts in my head. My whole soul is ready for sweet, blissful death but as yet I haven’t found the wherewithal to finally end it all, telling myself “one more day” or “one more week” and now it has been months and years and still I feel the same. No meds have helped, talking to a counselor has felt like walking in circles and any attempt I have made to better my mental state has led to me feeling all the more lost and weak when my best attempts fall flat.

Thoughts after a late diagnosis and medication,3,oxn3cl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxn3cl/thoughts_after_a_late_diagnosis_and_medication/,1,"I was emotionally abused for wanting to change schools, I failed high school, went on an exchange and got grounded by my host family, failed university preparation, was kicked from a club 4 times, dropped from a degree multiple times, struggled at a grocery store job, and smashed plenty of relationships from impulsive decisions. It turned out I had undiagnosed ADHD.

At each stage of life, my mother and I had disagreements on the direction of my life. She responded by emotionally abusing me. This happened each year from ages 15-18. At first, I learnt to embrace it, stating my wants and needs then letting the situation escalate. Later I learnt she plays nice when a counsellor gets involved, so I'd speak to her, she'd scream me down, then I'd involve a counsellor. This still affects me daily at 25.

I was going to commit suicide and a late-diagnosed ADHD read my story. He said it sounded like ADHD, so I saw psychiatrists who agree. I have ASD and ADHD.

Ritalin has made a clear difference for ADHD. I feel like myself. I felt like study and employment weren't options for me, now it does. I've been more productive. One of the big issues I had was whispering/talking/yelling to myself. I couldn't stop and nobody would hire me. Now it stopped. The trauma thoughts quietened down a lot.

[Long version here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latediagnosisadhd/comments/onxytn/my_story_failed_high_school_university/).

With the late diagnosis and effective medication comes a lot of thinking about myself, about others, about society.

I was discriminated against my whole life for something I didn't understand. Realising how different I am, and thinking about that impacted me negatively, can be quite isolating.

Developing CPTSD, starting 2 unwanted degrees against my will, cutting off my family, and a lot of wounds, smashed relationships and opportunities, difficulty with study and employment until I get a proper diagnosis was all non-negotiables for me.

I saw counsellors my whole life and nobody helped me in a meaningful way. It took a fucking Reddit comment to make sense of my life. What the fuck.

I've had my mother abuse me into submission with counsellors stepping in. I've had a meme group accuse me of crimes I didn't do, the same dude ended up getting in trouble for pressuring a woman into sex. I've had a far-left anarchist dig up old offensive messages, track down someone's home, and make up allegations about me to try to take me out. I've had a friend get convicted of sexual misconduct, another try send me legal threats and later turned out to be a domestic abuser against his partner, one mocked me for attempting suicide and likely will be an elected politician in the future. One dude I was good friends with ended being fully radicalised, had the police visit him, has a whole news article dedicated to him. He video called me talking about wanting to spark a revolution against Islam. I cut him off eventually.

The way you can tell something was up with me is most people could tell from afar to avoid these people. That it sounds like bad news. I didn't. I would repeatedly get involved, get burned, and not get the signal. I think this is probably part of ADHD, brain fog, not thinking much about consequences.

I've been hurt and attempts to ruin my life from both family and others. I've never gotten a sincere apology from anyone. Nobody has personal accountability even when confronted on it. I just maneuvered people to back off and show there will be consequences for messing with me. This seems to be the most meaningful way to move people.

I think people overall are self-interested, uncaring, and are more concerned about their appearance than their character. People want to look good, not be good. I've been treated like shit by counsellors for wanting to get help. I don't trust the politicians who claim to represent me to actually care. I've lost faith in other people. I don't trust others. I get judged for the stupid shit I've done in the past and people judge me for where my life has gone. ""Behind in life"" fuck you, try dealing with all my shit.

As the cost of housing rises, as the planet gets worse, as it is getting harder to just get by, I'm not sure if I even want to be on this planet. The world is cruel and uncaring. I don't really have much motivation to be here much longer.

But I have a lot of social support. I'm getting an ADHD coach. I'm working towards getting a job. I'm learning to drive. I'm moving ahead. But I feel subdued. I want to shelter myself from people. There are some truly depraved people out there.",1628060521.0,1

one thing that rubs salt into my wound is how different my parents treat my brother.nobody pressured him bcs he’s the only son(golden child..)when i ask my mom she simply said “he’s a boy and you’re a girl. boys are playful and that’s their nature, i can’t pressure him how i pressure you”oh istg it hurts. im not some kind of mannequin that doesn’t break and have no feelings. my entire childhood was pretty much ruined bcs of how hard i studied. adam gets expensive shit for stupid little things when i dont even have a cake for my birthday.he got nintendo for getting 3rd place when i only got more exercise books after getting 1st.but i never said anything, being the good girl I’m supposed to be

if i have issues with my parents why don’t i just talked it out with my friends?honey this mf right here got no friends.they’re so toxic, hating me for studying, talked behind my back and spread rumors until the seniors hates me. Bodyshamed me when im literally 45 kg until I developed bad habits like chewing without swallowing and occasionally digs my throat to throw up even when I don’t eat anything.quick reminder we stayed in hostel together. it’s not like i can put the toxicity aside and doesnt feel anything when we see each other every day

now im 17,takes science stream with new format that’s super hard (some topics include university syllabus) , going to sit for SPM (same as SAT) next march but already burnt out. online classes are hard bcs i have to stay at home with this family that im not even close with. i dont talk to any of them for almost a year even when we’re living under the same roof(i was rarely home after 13 bcs i enter private boarding highschool where we’re only home for two days every two months)

please do me a favor by giving one more reason to end this.the only thing holding me back is my religion but lately i think it’s ok since i already hurt myself. god hates me either way why should i bother trying anymore? thanks :)

Whats happened? Things have spiralled really fast. They always do. I knew a week or two ago that I needed to nip it in the bud. I let it draw me in again like Lust. It confuses me so much. 
I need to remember that ultimately I'm not allowed to die so I need to get off the train. 
It's weird that relationship within myself, doctor and patient, oppressor and oppressed, victim and perpetrator. Which side do I identify with the most?
I guess the active, caring, violent side is the drive and desire for better, its just misdirected. The victim, injured side is never where I fully lie either, because I am never one without the other. It's the contrast between the two which makes it so satisfying. And dirty. And confusing.
It clouds how I see my day, and I want to destroy. I get triggered when I am with other people and I am near blades or burning hot metal; I want to hurt myself in secret, in plain sight.
It forces me to lie. Pretend. Because its too awkward and embarrassing for other people to know whilst it's still right here, in control of my body and my mind. I don't care if people know about the past because it's not happening and I can own it. But whilst it's here, the other people become active members in it's presence and I dont understand it myself, so I'm not ready for other people's help.
I tell myself that people don't want to hear about how you want to hurt yourself. It almost insults them because they are a part of the world that is inadequate in the first place. In addition, it would insult them more that their advice and best intentions may not, probably help.

But at the same non-sensical time, speaking out allows me to own it, like I do the past depression, it allows me to have a voice against this parasite which has taken over. My logical conclusions say it shouldnt help. [Which side is my logic on?] -But it does help, should I have the courage to speak out against its rule.
However. I cannot remain on both trains, they have contrasting directions.
Duality. Again.

I cannot lie in submission, hot waves of throbbing information coursing through my blood, whilst also standing up tall and confident and LOUD.
I cannot read and write the narrative of dry misery and ugliness, whilst also reading and writing the lifefull, endless potential of my future. The trains have very different destinations.

Even my therapist doesn't know what to do with me; all my struggles involving selfharm and suicidal ideations seem to be getting worse and I don't see any way out. After being told to get professional help so many times, I thought things would be so much better, but I still feel stuck. Is anyone here struggling/struggled with something similar?",1628038918.0,1

In about 2 months from today, I will turn 26. The past 3 years have been a blur. I get the feeling, everyday, that the good days are gone, and nothing will feel remotely as happy as it did when I was younger. I have gained so much weight. It has been so long since I had a gf. I might need hip surgery and my left knee hurts aswell, so maybe I won't be able to play soccer with my friends ever again. I am still a few years away from getting my university degree, which should've been done by now.

I get that I'm still young, but I can't shake off this feeling of impending doom.  Seems to me, the only way to feel something good this days is by eating eating junk food, smoking weed or drinking beer. I try as hard as I can to live a healthy life, doing excercise and not depend on drugs to feel normal. But lately, maybe I just don't care anymore. The world is f\*cking ending, and no one seems to care about it. It's not just the pandemic, it's drought, climate change, and who knows what else. And it's all just starting.

is it normal or pretty darn bad that I became so depressed that I struggled to read? Is it pretty darn bad that I felt like I lost my personality after graduating college?

It was tolerable enough to memorize a powerpoint or read a subsection of a textbook; however, it was almost impossible to read several pages of a textbook or read and complete a novel of some sort. Post college, it became severelyyyy worse. It was hard to read more than two chapters of a book or so without taking a few breaks, and reading long passages in long graduate standardized exams gave me panic attacks. Fast forward to now, I decided to pick up on a few college classes as a career changer, as I avoided my initial desired career due to this fear of unable to reason and read difficult material as necessary as the track would be. I have been able to read so much more clearly. I can't tell if this clarity is due to overcoming some trauma that I had reopened and rectified, the amount of practice I've been doing, and/or the fact that I took a break from school and now am back in taking classes again. 

When I was in college, I valued school so much to the brink of depression. It wasn't helpful but it was necessary for me to put in a lot of time in the stuff I was learning, moreso than others, due to the fact that I struggled with reading and critical thinking while depressed. When I graduated, I felt like i could not do either. School was literally everything to me.....ofc now I realized it shouldn't have been that way. It was just way worse. Panic attacks and being unmedicated everywhere. Now that i've resumed school, everything is suddenly clear and it's so shocking that im writing this post. the impact of the panic attacks and gad and whatever was going on (ptsd idk) was terrible in my life. I just feel like I woke up from a coma from such depression. Still unmedicated too.

It is about the feeling that you can be *effective,* the confidence and pride you can only derive from the things you build with your hands, the words that fall into paper, the notes you assemble for a song's sake, or the images you bring to life only through the care and pressure of your skill and your will.

You derive those joys because you've made something, and you've made something because you've believed in something; in the process, you have also made something others can believe in, you share the weight of insecurity and improbability, and with that relief the chance to rethink your image on the mirror, and that of what you've made.

You cannot carry on *alone*. No one carries on *alone*, because nobody is anyone *alone*. You're told to carry on, to keep on failing, to keep on *improving* at a cost that is higher every year, because your youth runs dry and your hopes die down, but you're told to *carry on.*

Unfortunately we got on a touchy subject which I thought would be alright but it ended up being what I think to be a sore spot for her. After that she seemed a lot less affectionate and was more closed off. She still seemed to be enjoying herself and stayed for longer than she intended but it just wasn’t the same.

I still thought it went really well but at the end she said that “she didn’t feel any chemistry but she would really like to hang out again as friends”, I just felt like I was punched in the stomach when she said that. I still feel pain in my stomach right now, I told her over text that I’m down to be friends but our conversation doesn’t feel the same, I guess I just still feel pain so it’s hard for me to try to make her laugh and what not so I think I’ll pause on texting her for a bit

I just can’t get it out of my head, I feel like an idiot, I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up, I shouldn’t have talked about such a stupid topic and I should’ve flirted with her to make a romantic feeling but I thought I didn’t need to cuz she seemed so interested.

I have the world's biggest guilty conscience so even the smallest lie would kill me coz of guilt. I am also not a sexual person. I overthink a whole lot but since I've always been busy up until quarantine, none of the overthinking thoughts affected me. Overall I'd say I'm an amazing person, that's what I've always thought about myself up until quarantine decided to destroy my mental health and everything is plain fucked up right now....

THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

I made a grave error of letting myself be completely idle this quarantine. The childhood sexual abuse I went through when I was 5 suddenly popped inside my mind and I went into sever depression by obsessively thinking about it( though it's never bothered me till now, I'm 20) . I'd become curious about my own body and accidentally discovered masturbation, which is so out of character for me. It lead to shame more guilt and I've stopped it completely after about 7-8 weeks but I still feel guilty af about it. I've seen my best friends doing all this productive fun stuff with their friends but I don't have any friends in my country now since we've all been out of touch since I left for another country for grade 9-12. I started just screenshot ting stuff from other people's stories or something and posting it on my story to make it.look like I'm eating good food and having a good time like everyone else since I felt plain boring (I did it about 5 times before my guilty conscience shut me down). 

I've been away from the love of my life for 2 years now (we should've met if not for corona). And I cry everyday coz I'm miss him so much. Idk if it's because of my extreme love for him and my extreme loneliness right now that I started having all these terrible intrusive thoughts including other guys and it deeply disturbed me. I then realized I had pure obsessional ocd when I talked to a therapist online.

All of these things are things I would never have done if I was back in my university having actual stuff to do. All of these things are the exact opposite of my personality since I'm literally the biggest Optimist anyone has ever seen (that's what people tell me). So me doing and thinking all this makes me wonder....IS IT ALL BECAUSE OF MY IDLE MIND ? OR WHAT? I NEED HELP FROM Y'ALL ON HOW I CAN OVERCOME IT...

Scars,1,oxp7rp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxp7rp/scars/,0,"What was this all for?


Was it punishment for some future sins, I have yet to commit? Or perhaps sins committed so long ago they're written into the pages of history? Or maybe just maybe, there was no reasoning. 
Maybe bad things just happen. Maybe I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe it wasn't a punishment as such,  a learning experience from a young age, created to forge me into the person who I am today. Maybe. Or maybe it was just bad luck.

 Either way, I feel as if though it's important to address these experiences as what they truly are. To strip them back to the bone and stop questioning why. Because sometimes there is no why. There is no how or when. There just is. And nothing can change that. The past after all, is a double ended blade. It can harm and it can heal. You can learn from it and you can lie about it. You can twist it and morph it, blanket it in a shroud of lies. But the truth will always remain whether it is acknowledged or not. The pain will never go away. You can't lie it out of existence. The only way forwards is to accept that it hurts. And maybe some day, the bleeding will stop, and the wound will begin to heal. It won't just go away though. It'll leave a nasty scar, but my dear, those scars will help you remember who you are, and what you've done.


 Whether you've fought against the dark phantoms of the mind, or the monsters hidden behind the facade of a friendly smile and a heart of gold, you are strong. Your scars will remind you of the battles you have fought and the pain you have endured. Wear them with pride. Acknowledge the sorrow they have brought you, and cast it away, like a stone on a pond. And then maybe one day you’ll be able to smile again. Maybe one day everything will feel okay. Things might get better, but then again, they might not. Just remember how strong you are for continuing this fight when you can't even see any light at the end of your long tunnel. It'll never be the same as before, but it would be a bit dull, if everything stayed the same don't you think?


I don't really know if this is the right place to post this. I just felt like it needed to be shared, and this is the only place I post things. I'm sorry if its in the wrong place. Let me know if it is, and I'll change it. 

Thank you for reading.

why does everyone abandon me??,3,oxihzl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxihzl/why_does_everyone_abandon_me/,0,"last night my semi-boyfriend (who shall be referred to as JT) told me he didn't foresee himself being able to love me, despite putting in effort, and that he felt it was best we go our separate ways. I cried and cried and begged him not to leave me, but he said it had to be this way. he's moving across the world soon, so today was probably the last time I'd ever see him again. the one comfort I have in this situation is that he cried with me and he seemed to be genuinely heartbroken at the decision he made. 

it's not just him though, before this guy there was another who shall be referred to as SP, who left me for another girl. My ex, who I dated for two years, kept wanting to sleep with other girls while being with me. The list goes on and on, mostly ending with them abandoning me for one reason or another. It's always ""you're so smart and pretty and funny, but..."", and I don't know how much more of this I can take.

when I was a kid, my parents never told me they loved me or cared about me, nor did they show it - so I grew up believing that they didn't. that's my theory as to why I put my heart and my soul into pleasing potential partners, and why it's so devastating for me especially when things go awry. I've felt so alone for my entire life, so if a pretty boy shows up and gives me some attention or affection I fall head over heels for them.

i was bullied so bad in elementary school and middle school that in 8th grade, i switched to going to school online. in middle school, i self harmed, and attempted to end my life twice. i then developed a severe eating disorder that almost killed me, and landed me in the hospital for months. 

when i got out of the hospital i was 18. i had one year of school left to complete. i chose to go back to public school. i was raped by a kid i had classes with and dropped out a month before i would have graduated, because i couldn’t handle being there. 

after being raped, i found drugs. developed a raging meth & fentanyl addiction that went on for years. was physically beaten my dealer daily. eventually got clean. 

tried to find work. stayed at each place for a max of three months before quitting. i could not handle any type of conflict or people treating me poorly. last july i was invited by my family to work at our family business. it’s been great for me, but mentally has been a challenge. dealing with rude customers takes a toll on my soul and my heart. 

i just feel as though i’ve accomplished nothing and gone no where in life. my dad has bought every single one of my cars. he still helps me out with cash because i mentally cannot handle a full time job. i rely heavily on my family because i am so stunted by my limited emotional capacity and inability to preserve. 

the past two weeks my depression has been completely unmanageable. i’ve fallen back into self harm and disordered eating. yesterday i stayed in bed all day. i’m writing this sitting in the parking lot at work because i’m too busy crying to be able to function in my position. i feel like i am failing everyone and everything. i had so many dreams as a kid and they all feel so impossible to even begin to imagine again. i don’t know what to do. this is not how i ever imagined my life.",1628033508.0,1

Help. WHAT SHOULD I DO?: I need serious help but I'm not sure how to go about reaching out for it.,1,oxo6nl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxo6nl/help_what_should_i_do_i_need_serious_help_but_im/,2,"***TW: emotional, physical ab\*se, suic\*de, self-in\*\*ry***

Hello. I'm Nozomi (not my real name for anon). First of all, I just want to thank this community for creating a safe space for topics like this and for welcoming me. I've been a lurker of online communities like this and recently decided to create another Reddit account to officially join as I am very anxious to even browse around content as such with my real identity.

I am in an unhealthy environment and I have been planning to move out for years now because of my suicidal tendencies that are brought upon by the situation that I am in. I have not been able to successfully do this because of the lack of job opportunities that welcome me and my mental health condition, and the lack of financial support. I do have a job now that is better for my mental health and is promising finance-wise but it will take me months to be able to earn a specific amount of income to move out safely and I don't know how long I have until the next episode I'll have in this toxic household. The pandemic has made it all worse for me and my productivity having to survive and work for myself in this place 24/7.

I was advised that I could reach out for help from online communities like this but I'm still very skeptical of the idea that people would be able to help while I stay anonymous. I feel like the act of raising funds to be able to move out without anyone knowing my real identity, is far from possible and may just be seen as a scam, or worse, risk being found out about my abusive family but I also can't pass up ANY opportunity to finally get out of this situation. **What do you guys think I should do?**

I decided to get help and have this posted around online communities that I feel safe in to gather advice if this is possible, how to go about it and if there are other feasible ways that I can save up to move out. I know this is going to be a very long post but I feel that in order for me to get help, I need to give context as to what my situation is.

As many of you all, I am a product of two abusive parents who are not together anymore but are both still able to hurt their children. I'm in my early 20s, living with my emotionally and physically abusive mom and 2 of my siblings. Saying the words abusive along with introducing who my parents are, especially my mom makes me extremely anxious for the reason that for a long time, I believed that everything was normal and that I was loved and cared for, but the difference was that the kind of ""love"" they gave me involved hitting me, screaming hurtful words at me, and showing subtle reminders that I am always wrong, to teach me lessons. After slowly realizing and growing out of that belief, I have also observed the ways that they gaslight and guilt-trip their children into thinking that resisting against them is an act of sin, selfishness, and ungratefulness. And yes, even now, at the time that I am writing this, the feeling of being a cruel daughter, a selfish and ungrateful one, is lingering. But the fact that I have tried so hard and so many times to see and feel that I am loved, to bond, to reconnect, and to even heal with them, only to feel disappointed, hurt, and even feel sort of shocked sometimes to be reminded that the home I'm looking for is nowhere near where these people are.

I badly care for my parents and I still love my mom so much but most days with her feel like I'm not wanted and that she shouldn't have had me. I remember when I used to be that little kid in the corner of the room sobbing and struggling to breathe after my dad had just whipped whatever he had in his hand at my small body, with my mom watching, they would insist that it was just because they loved me and for a while, I really believed that people who hurt you could also just love you.

My sister also grew up in this situation but I took most of the hits for her as well because my parents used to say that it was because I was the eldest and whatever wrong my sister did was my fault, and I really didn't mind most of the hits I took for her, because she was so small and it hurt a lot. I think my brother never experienced that level of physical abuse my dad did but he gets a few minor hits here and there from my mom now and my sister and I don't get hit anymore. My brother shows a lot of verbal resistance from my mom's physical abuse and I remember a time when he even brought up the actual words of ""child abuse"" at her and I was so scared for him that time. I remember my mom was upset at it but the hitting didn't get worse, thankfully.

Out of all my siblings, I'm considered as the black sheep because I show most of the resistance to how we're brought up, and because of this, I get most of the amount of abuse that I and my siblings get from our parents, but I do know that less abuse is still abuse. They do get better treatment than I get and they also somehow hate me because I'm pictured as the selfish member of the family for being the most sensitive, dramatic, and needy sibling, also most probably because I distance myself from them and I'm always unhappy and upset to be around with when I'm around family. I badly want to work as hard as I can to get them out of this situation but I can't help them if I can't even help myself.

The situation now looks like this. My parents are separated, we live with our mom, my dad has his other kids and girlfriend to go home to but he visits us every other week or so. My dad is the worst, every time that he's here at home, I distance myself as much as I can because he just makes me extremely uncomfortable and every interaction we have that goes for more than 10 seconds turns into a big argument, and sometimes, him threatening to hit me, and every time this happens, I go into a full breakdown, he leaves as if nothing happened, I go into a full month of dysfunction and suicidal breakdowns that my mom would notice and be mad about. He would come to visit a few weeks after as if nothing happened and I would try to forget and try to come back from the dead to avoid being more of a disappointment to my mom.

My mom is a different story. She used to hit us less which made me believe that she was kind because she hit us less and she said she didn't like hitting us but as I grew up I think she just didn't like to be painted as the bad guy. I've always felt like she hated me, she has always said negative things about me, straightforward and subtle. About how I look, act, and talk, and I have always felt uncomfortable around her because she has always made me feel ugly and worthless. People, and I think she believes this too, see her as this kind woman who is never angry and never confrontational but I see a different woman at home.

I used to think that I was finally not scared of my parents anymore because my dad isn't around that much anymore and I've gotten good at hiding stuff from my mom but I have always been scared of her. I feel that I'm on the lookout 24/7. Every move I make is criticized and every move she makes, I have to analyze. Is she angry? Is she about to say something hurtful now? What is the safest thing to do in order not to upset her? and other things I constantly am anxious about.

She doesn't hit me anymore but she does and says things that still make me fear for my safety. One time, she was cooking and was using a knife while being upset at me and I honestly had to sit up just enough to be ready for whatever it is that's about to happen, but I believe the emotional abuse is what keeps me at my lowest ever since my dad left us. I know she's hurt and I feel so bad for how she's hurt but hurt people really do hurt people don't they?

I have read about narcissistic parents across communities like this and for a while, I really didn't want to believe that my mom is a narcissistic mother but the more I recognize the signs from over the years of living with her issues, I can say that she has narcissistic tendencies that result to her being emotionally abusive.

One time, I had the stupidest mistake to tell our school counselor about my suicidal thoughts about the toxic household I'm in and what they decided to do was call my mom in. Of course, I got home to my mom visibly upset, crying, screaming, and telling me how ungrateful I am, asking me where she went wrong about raising such a child. That was the same reaction she had when she found out about me cutting up my wrists. This is why I've always been extremely anxious about reaching out for help myself.

I could list down all the nasty and horrible shit that goes down in this household between me and this family but this post is getting very long and it takes a lot of energy from me to relay all of these painful things but my objective with this post is to really get advice on how to safely move out. If you may ask me how I'd be able to maintain taking care of myself if I am to live on my own, I have a job that is kind to my brain and I enjoy it so much but having to develop this promising job to get me a stable income, in an environment that I'm in is like trying to take care of a perfectly healthy and happy fish in contaminated water. It's so bad here that I'd be the happiest I'd ever be in an empty apartment alone.

That's it for now. I'd welcome any questions and hopefully suggestions. Again, thank you so much for this safe space. **I am so grateful to know that I am not alone ❤️**

**📌 TL:DR: In an unhealthy environment with suicidal tendencies, not sure if anonymously raising funds online to get me out is possible, might be seen as a scam but I'm open to suggestions, working on a promising job to get me on a stable income, but it will me take months to be able to move out safely, working in a toxic environment delays it all, would raising funds be a good idea to at least take me out of here safely?**",1628065530.0,1

Long rant about how much I hate myself.,1,oxnvz0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxnvz0/long_rant_about_how_much_i_hate_myself/,0,"I've been struggling with these feelings for a very long time, but after a very recent meltdown and noticeable changes in my own mental state, I think I need some help figuring my own head out. Unfortunately the only way I can adequately explain or vent out my problems is to tell a lot of my life story, so I'm sorry in advance for how long this will be, especially to those dedicated enough to actually read it all. But here goes.   


I'm 25. I turn 26 next month. I'm autistic, specifically I have Asperger's Syndrome. Growing up, there were several things I had a hard time with. Recognizing social cues was a major factor, but more than that I had issues with hallucinations and controlling my emotions. As far as I know every child has issues controlling their anger and other such emotions, but I had a lot of issues with it - that'll be touched on later, though. Because I had hallucinations on a constant basis, I often poked people to make sure they were real. Unfortunately a lot of people didn't like being touched, and the teacher's weren't able to explain it to the students, so naturally it became difficult for me to make friends between the poking and the social difficulties of growing up autistic. I hurt a lot of kids in fifth grade in particular, though I've always assumed that had to do with home troubles - one of my sisters had moved in with us for one, and that came with a lot of stress since she was schizophrenic and manipulative, but more than that, my brother, in middle school at the time, was coming into sexuality and decided because he hated me so much (with good reason - I was shitty to him) that he would use me to 'practice' for when he started actually getting female attention. So between my brother raping me before I knew what rape even was and the stress of the new sibling in the house, it was a bad time all around - although my teacher the previous year hadn't helped any. A tale for another time - suffice to say she hated me because she'd had my brother years before, and my brother was a troublemaker because his own home life was shit no thanks to me.   


But more than the home troubles or the rape, my existence, my personality, my whole sense of worth has been measured in the vast quantity of fuck-ups that have persisted throughout my life. You would think that 26 years into life I'd start learning from my mistakes, but here we are. As a child, I was never really able to learn anything for the sake of normal living other than through osmosis because any attempt to gain said experience often ended in fucking it up. I wasn't allowed to cook until I was in middle school, and only because I had a home ec class. I was seldom asked to clean anything up, because I often used the wrong chemical due to poor parental supervision. The only things I was allowed to do for chores that I couldn't screw up were taking out the trash and walking the dogs. It was certainly enjoyable having nothing to do all day, but honestly, I suffer much now because of it - the only food I can make is eggs or mac and cheese. In more recent times, I've had a lot of issues with my girlfriend who recently underwent major spinal surgery and has been bedridden for a month or so. Any time I try to do something for her without active prompting from someone, it seems to either get in the way or end up fucking something else up. It's gotten to the point where I can't bring myself to do anything without being told to because I'm just getting in the way. It hasn't helped any that home life is incredibly stressful for many reasons that I don't have it in me to explain right now (this post has already taken a lot of energy and I feel like I'm not saying enough of the right things for context) but suffice to say a lot has been making it difficult for me to keep my own emotions in check. More than anything, I need advice.  I'm so tired of being angry all the time, ready to bite anyone's head off for even the slightest of corrections. I don't feel like I can actually do anything I enjoy to take my mind off of things - I can't go for walks, since she needs constant care. I can't play most of my video games for a number of reasons relating to her. I just... I need some way to get this under control. To ease my stress, to lower my anger, to feel like I'm not just... some fuck-up who nobody should have to be burdened with. I want to feel like I offer as much happiness as I imagine she gives me, but I just feel... nothing all the time. I wish I could know what it was like to feel something again, anything other than anger or self-loathing. I wish I could smile and for once actually mean it...",1628064171.0,1

The story begins before the divorce, our house is in the end of a road because when we moved to Canada my 2 sisters were still young so my mom thought it would be safe to buy a house like that so when we play we have less chance to get hit by a car and right next to us is a small forest. Because of that there are very good amount of wild animals near us, and one of the animals that are annoying us is the rats that won't stop comming into the house. So we decided to have cats so the rats will get scared away me personally I really really like pets, we bought 3 cats one after another, and it actually worked.  But Good times don't last long, two of the cats left the house and never came back, because we like to let our cats go outside and discover around the house, and also completely get rid of rats. We don't know untill today why they left us, maybe because they got into danger (there's coyotes in our area). I got really sad and cried, that only cat that stayed was our main character of this story her name's attagirl (translated, real name is XiaoGuai)she's just like other two cats, also likes to go outside. she was with me and looking through my eyes, maybe wondering why I was crying or confused by why other two cats disappeared. But that was very touching. Anyways, not long after my parents separated (if you guys want to hear that story I can do it too, it's also a very crazy story) and 2 years after when she turns 4 years old, I'm not even sure about her exact age because I am a terrible owner but we know the year we got her (2017) and she was only few months old. So when she's about 4 years old my mom started to notice something unusual, attagirl starts to be deppressed and desperately wants to go outside, before when we want to keep her inside she just trys a few times and give up, but starting from few months ago, if we don't let her go outside she just become sad and keep looking outside, and there is were the true nightmare begins. She lost tons of weight just in 2 or 3 weeks and she kept scratching her face untill it bleeds and doesn't even stop. So we took her to an emergency clinic, and paid 800 bucks for a blood test and an injection of a weak antivirus. The doctor said she doesn't know what's going on with her and need to keep doing tests, but the cost will be at 2.1k so my mom decided to not do that because we can't afford it. We took her home and 3 days late she lost her vision, we set her up at a bedroom and fed her food everyday even tho she barely eats any. and last night I was in my bed watch my phone and I heard a little meow sound, from my door. And I got confused because her room is pretty far from mine, and she barely meows even when she's healthy, so I went to her room and a few moments later she suddenly stand up and walked around, she couldn't control her balance because of the blindness, and finally she fell on the ground and can only breathe. I stayed besides her it was 2am and I stayed untill 5am then I couldn't open my eyes anymore so I went to sleep. This morning, we know she's at her limit, even when she started to be blind we asked another doctor her said attagirl will not live longer and I cried my fucking assoff, I tried to bring her back to the clinic but my mom said no, because it's too expensive and may not even find a solution, this is fate we can't stop it. She also said pets like these will always go ahead of us, it's just a Mather of time.

I'm so useless, I'm only 17 and only has 1 job, can't do anything, can't make enough money, can only cry and watch her suffers to death. This happened because we lack of experience, if we brought her to vet earlier maybe this will never happen and she will live longer than now. I'm so so so depressed. And because of covid we didn't do the injection she should be doing every year that perhaps was also a reason.

I have always had problems with socialising and making friends. I even switched school's because I couldn't make ANY friends. My parents thought that this school I go to currently will help me make friends but what happened next is the complete opposite. I was in a new class with new people and had to start over. Mind you this was in 3rd grade. I wrote all my classmate's names in a piece of paper and tried to make friends with them. But I had to switch classes and had to start over AGAIN. This section however was filled with condescending dicks who bullied EVERYDAY. And I couldn't tell this to my parents as they would complain to my teacher which would further reduce my chances of making friends. So now I had to try and make friends with literal dumbarses who bullied every single day and mind you I WAS STILL IN 3RD GRADE! This continued untill 5th grade where I was thankfully given a very good teacher to rely upon. Same goes for 6th grade too. Amazing teacher and overall best year by FAR. But from here there will be no good years AT.ALL.

&#x200B;

7th grade ruined my motivation for life. Terrible teacher and worst bulling ever. Everyone had their own group of friend and seeing them in field trips or during PE made me terribly depressed. I decided if I'm not making any friends might as well use my time studying like hell! Then I will pass all exams and make loads and loads of friends right? Riiight? Nope. Not at all. Just before my final exam of the year I studied till 11:30 PM. During the actual test I found all questions to be a slice of delicious lemon cake. Or easy. But I had gotten  16%. Out of 100%. Then came the blitzkrieg of bullying. Fat shaming, calling me a retard and making fun of me. At this point I had given up on life completely and my only hope was to seek a therapist. And i didnt tell any of this bullying to my parents. Like a idiot i kept all of it in me. Eventually this sadness took over me and has made a shell of what I used to be. Optimistic, Extroverted, Happy and smiling. Now I'm Introverted, pessimistic, suicidal, and self hating. I always thought of myself as a happy guy which loads of talent. Now I think of myself as waste of sperm cells. I told my parents about this and they said and I quote, ""What problems do you have which you have to be depressed about?!"" And they would refuse to get me a therapist or psychologist. I have no-one in my life who cares about me and am very close to jumping off Of a building. Whoever  is seeing this, help me.

I suffer with depression and other disorders but despite that i just want to enjoy living my life doing things i like

I genuinely liked to play volleyball, even though ive never played on teams or had anyone other than myself to play with

Instead of mindlessly slapping the ball i decided to start practicing skills when quarantine started. and i actually got better. But then i moved highschools and towns and then the peak of my depression insued

i wanted to die so bad, i had nothing i wanted to live for. everything just felt so hopeless. i stopped doing things i liked, and i stop practicing for about a year

needless to say, recently i found the incentive to get off my ass, and became more productive 

i found out my school was doing volleyball tryouts, and even though i havent touched the sport in months, i wanted to challenge myself and see if i could make the team. I am aware my skills are very mediocre, but i wanted to finally have a place i could go to improve my skills. 

but yeah, no shit i didnt make it. and even though i expected it, the more i think about it the more i want to rip my limbs off. I tried hard trying to get back into volleyball with the resources i had. I had to serve, pass, and set all by myself because i had no friends who wanted to play with me. I've been wanting to joing a club or hire a coach, but i know damn well i dont have the money. It feels like i couldve done more but i didnt. and it feels like im not privileged enough to play the damn sport. i dont want to give up. its so fun, but i cant imagine improving by just passing the ball to myself over and over again. I'm thinking of asking my mom to let me join a club (costs money, ofc), but i get to frustrated thinking about all those kids who are younger than me who were allowed to join clubs and sharpen their skills from young ages and were supported by their parents. I cant help but feel like theres no reason for me to get started now. Im a sophmore in high school and if i were to try out next year as a junior, i wouldnt be enough. 

I went out of my way to become eligible for tryouts. I canceled my doctor appointment that day (paid a no-show fee), went to the doctor last minute to get my physical, and spent days practicing nonstop. I cant help but feel ashamed and embarrased. people i know were rooting for me, and now it feels like they just pity me. I'd figure i'd be actually good at this damn sport by now, but nope. 

and what are the chances of me catching covid while training with other people? i just cant win. all that echos in my head is ""its not fair, its not fair."" 

i just want to be passionate about something. i want to be good at something for once. i want to be cheered on. and the idea of pursuing this dream any further is just making me bitter.

It's been a struggle to function beyond the bare minimum, and I've got a lot of responsibilities in my life related to my career that I can't currently abandon due to financial and insurance needs.

I'm passively suicidal, and I dislike the intrusive thoughts, the paranoia and anxiety that follows me everywhere, and the anhedonia and avolition. It's becoming harder to go on, and it's affecting my work life, my social life, and my family life.

About the only things keeping me afloat are my husband, our cats, planning the cross-country move my husband and I are trying to make next year, very specific music, and the movie Wristcutters: A Love Story. Pretty much nothing else gives me any semblance of joy. I've even stopped finding joy in reading, and that's my ADHD fixation for just about every situation that brings me stress.

I want to feel something besides despair and crushing sadness again. I want to have intrinsic motivation instead of having to drag myself through the motions once more.

Do I really deserve this?,1,oxl3ph,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxl3ph/do_i_really_deserve_this/,0,"I am alone with little to no friends, only a couple family members still around and I am not close with.

The couple people I talk to it seems like I bug them more and its a hassle to talk or play a online game. 
Maybe its me missing the connection of friends and texting or calling  just to shoot the shit. I may miss having that girl to talk to. But  seems like the ones I did talk to have moved on and don't want to talk to me even as a friend. Then trying to make new friends that are girls forget it, seems like all they want is that Sixpack or asshole guy. I have tried to be the nice guy and help people out and it always bites me in the end. I dont wanna be the asshole cause thats not me to be one, it would tear me up inside. 
Slowly feeling like I am letting everyone down, and it kills me inside. I wanna die and be better off, but the reality is im scared to take my life cause I don't know what happens next.

Is this alone feeling what I am destined for in life?

Letter of hope,3,oxemsp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxemsp/letter_of_hope/,2,"I wrote this letter to a general audience as I’m currently in the midst of the worst part of one of my depressive swings. I wrote it knowing one day this will be true, that I will get to the other side. I read it when I’m feeling my worst, sometimes 5x in an hour. I hope it helps someone as much as it is helping me. 

“Depression: it’s an ugly disorder that is unyielding and unkind. I’m a long-time sufferer of anxiety and depression. While I’m normally able to keep depression at bay most days, a recent breakup triggered in me many insecurities and wounds that sent me spiraling to that dark place and left me feeling alone and helpless. Only recently did I get to the other side. I want everyone to know it’s ok to not be ok. Use your network: reach out to friends, call a hotline, journal, get a therapist, just don’t do it alone. Keep doing the small things: shower, brush your teeth, comb your hair, even if that’s all you can muster all day. Take care of yourself: eat what you can when you can, watch movies, cry it out, take a sick day, fill your calendar with things to look forward to or people that will make you get out of bed. Depression can lie and say we’re in it by ourselves, but nothing is further from the truth. While social media can be deceiving and convince us everyone else around us is happy and has the perfect life, we have to remember that it is a heavily filtered version of reality. No one posts pictures of the days they can’t get out of bed. No one posts about the nights they cry themselves to sleep on the bathroom floor. No one writes about the immense loneliness, emptiness, and numbness they battle with on a daily basis. But if I’ve learned anything in life, it’s that everything changes, nothing is permanent, for good or bad. This too shall pass. There is hope on the other side; get help, just don’t give up.”",1628029822.0,1

I hate myself and feel numb. I fake a smile and laugh around people. I overeat because I'm miserable, and I'm miserable because I overeat. I fluctuate between being underweight and a normal weight multiple times a month. All I do is sleep, wake up, go to work, put on a mask, return ""home,"" binge to the point of physcial pain, regret it then punish myself by not eating, cry myself to sleep--repeat.

i am the villain,1,oxk996,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxk996/i_am_the_villain/,0,"anon, she/her/hers

I've done some pretty not cool stuff in my time on earth. But none of it is bad enough to the point where I feel this horrible.

The amount of times I've had people tell me I am the problem, or that I'm toxic, or that I'm crazy is so unfathomable, sometimes I start to think maybe it is true. I don't respond to texts, I'm nosy, I give half-assed advice, and I can't give my love to anybody without giving them too much of me. Recently, well not even recently, since I can remember... I've always felt like a failure. I do everything right, but my family has criticism. I do something wrong and suddenly everybody in the entire world will gang up on me and deflate my sense of self worth. My self esteem is so low I feel like I am barely a person. Just a husk of what once was floating around this world with no purpose. Maybe it would be easier just being that husk and having no responsibilities. Life is the the worst gift any human can be given. I am a disappointment to my dad, my employer, and my teachers. I don't have a work-ethic, I'm shit in school, and I have no energy for small talk. I don't want special treatment yet I wish people could stop looking at me as if I just don't care about life. I do! My brain will not let me be the way other ""normal"" people are. People will mistake my depression for weakness. Which to be fair it is a weakness but not in the sense I mean. In every argument I have, I don't fight back. I comply and move along. So many people take advantage of this and use it to punish me for things I've said in the past or use it to call me toxic because I didn't check up on them when ""they needed it"". How about when I needed it? I don't understand that why out of everybody that I know, I have to be the punching bag. I have to be the one to put the blame on. It is so tiring and exhausting being the only person recognized by my peer who has flaws. 

I thought maybe I could find god and get some sight through this lull. That didn't work either. I thought maybe if I started therapy that would help. it didn't. Maybe eating 3 meals a day would give my face a glow. My skin is still hollow and dull. Maybe falling in love would bring back the glimmer in my eyes. I drove them away. I thought maybe, just maybe, if I moved out and tried to figure out who I am without my family and friends I could rediscover my inner child or whatever those meditation apps try to sell. now I just feel guilty for leaving everybody behind and burning all my bridges.

I know I'm not the only person out there who feels like this. But nobody I knows personally understands how difficult it is to get through each day. 

thanks for reading this.

much love,

What Depression Feels Like When You're in the Rock Bottom,7,ox7pv0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ox7pv0/what_depression_feels_like_when_youre_in_the_rock/,1,"Depression is like a cycle. Sometimes you're in best of the best, but then there are times you're in the rock bottom. You don't even know the definition of being okay, so you pretend to be cheerful or fake a smile in front of everyone.

I just realized that I'm currently at the rock bottom when I'm noticing that I've been randomly calling a lot of my friends recently. Most of the time, they won't accept the call because their busy with adulting. Even one of my friends got mad at me for calling randomly without telling first that I want to call her. I understand that we are all struggling well with adulting, but I'm too ashamed to admit that I can't cope up just like the normal adults should. No wonder people with loved ones who died due to depression (like committing suicide) regret in the end because they didn't pay attention. 

With regards to my family, I have a good relationship with them. But I'm having a difficulty to tell them how I truly feel. So I just pretend to be the cheerful person they know. 

Also, I've been prone to mistakes lately and I'm always scolded for always saying sorry but just do mistakes again. To be honest, I don't want to commit mistakes, but I'm too weak to act normally or even pretend to be okay. 

Although, it's alright. I just needed to let this off my chest. I know how to make myself feel better again. The only being I can only talk about this is God and my psychiatrist. I know that I just need to be patient and kind with myself, but it's really difficult to act on it when you're at the bottom. Like you couldn't control your mind as much as you want to set yourself free and be happy again.

The sad reality that I'm having difficulty to accept is that when you grow up  (and become an adult) and suffering depression, not everyone will have the time to listen or be with you because their busy with their own lives. So at the end of everything, you silently fight your battles alone.",1628009953.0,1

Recently my girlfriend of 9 months broke up with me out of the blue, and things were really bad for about a week. When I was at work, I was running the register and I got this really cute girls number. We started chatting, and things were looking good. She told me how she can’t do relationships right now for a valid reason that I understand that I’m not going to get into for privacy reasons. Our friendship is still good, and I appreciate having her in my life, but since she said that I’ve been slowly slipping back into that bad place again. Thankfully, thoughts of getting high aren’t very active, but I keep picturing myself playing with guns, pointing them at my head, etc; and I’ve been thinking about ending it more and more frequently. My medication isn’t really helping anymore, just helps me sleep, and my doctor doesn’t want to change them while I’m in a bad place because it’s a serious gamble and he wants to wait till I’m in a better place mentally to change it. 

I don’t like having women play this much into my mental state. I can’t keep living like this. I have no drive to get up and do things anymore. I stopped playing call of duty because it doesn’t make me feel anything anymore. I only have been able to make myself eat once a day because I don’t get hungry anymore. I have been vaping a lot more it it doesn’t make me feel anything anymore, just makes me not want to hit again. I’ve been fighting with my mom more and sometimes I think about hitting her when I’m angry. I’m becoming more and more desperate for female attention and sex, but all attempts to far have failed miserably. 

Last night, as I was falling asleep in my deeply medicated babble, I remember picturing I was talking to the girl from work, saying “I don’t care if your a lit grenade, waiting to explode. I just want to hold you” (I know it sounds dumb, but this is as close to talking to my subconscious as it gets.)

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I can remember wanting to kill my self as far back as 4th grade, but it’s never been this bad before. Today was my first day off in 5 days and all I’ve done is lie in bed, In My filthy room and watch YouTube and play gta on and off. None of my coping skills are working anymore.

It's finally time for me to come out of the background and make my first post - and it's in the name of Mental Health Awareness - and Raising Money to Donate towards supports for those struggling with mental health.

A little about me (30M) - I am a Nurse, have been for over 8 years now. A few of those years were in hospitals, a few working with pediatrics in the community and in schools, a few working in a facility designed for mental health rehabilitation and recovery, and a few years with the developmental disabilties sector. While doing all that, I also got a degree in Information Technology and started my IT/Nursing Hybrid Career. Wierd combo I am told - but those are the two things that I love to do.

Anyways - One common thing I saw that was a common theme in all of the workplace settings, and even amongst my friends, and social groups - \* Everyone struggles with mental health at some point in their life \*

Even if its a little depression here, or a little anxiety there - many of us don't even realize. Of course some can cope better than others, and it doesn't always show as prevalent in us all. But trust me when I say that everyone struggles.

I will tell you when I worked on a unit for those suffering from PTSD - I remember sitting and listening to some of the horiffic stories that these individuals told, and had to have experience in their lives, and I just remember thinking that I was no different from any one of these people. If I had gone through what they had, or felt the pain that they had, I would be in the same boat. What I learned was that no one is immune from the toll that this world places on our mental health.

I myself had been hospitalized for some severe depression and addiction in the past. It's fun for no one.

So I come to you today Reddit to Help me Help those that are struggling - as this cause means so much to me. I have designed this Shirt with this cause in mind **ALL PROCEEDS WILL BE DONATED**. Check it out at this link --> [https://danteswaresnstoof.creator-spring.com/listing/don-t-bottle-it-up-mental-he?product=2](https://danteswaresnstoof.creator-spring.com/listing/don-t-bottle-it-up-mental-he?product=2)

In the end all we have is each other - And we can make a difference.",1628044425.0,1

Serotonin Syndrome Scare: SSS no I,1,oxiobo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxiobo/serotonin_syndrome_scare_sss_no_i/,0,"I’ve been taking Zoloft 50mg for two years: my weight yo-yos but my mood is pretty stable. I see a sleep specialist and in April told me he can’t help me until I get off that and suggested Effexor. I took Effexor for three months: lost 10lbs, sleep very well (I’m SO TIRED al the time!) but I’m overly emotional and sensitive. Sleep doctor said to start taking Remeron at night. I did tell him about my decline in emotional stability. Me and my supervisor at work aren’t what you would call “friends” and I called him crying about my position in life. People in my social circle have stopped inviting me to do things it’s made that big of a difference. I put myself back onto Zoloft and within a week I feel way better. But, in that week, I already notice weight gain (I’m only 5’0”. A little bit goes a long way). I read last night Effexor can help you lose weight.

I really don't know what to do.,1,oxiefp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxiefp/i_really_dont_know_what_to_do/,0,"I thought having a vacation, on a sunny island would help rebuild myself. Like my therapist said it would. It kind of work, but I still feel like crap. Another weird thing that happened recently: I keep seeing ""these"" things disturbing me day after day. It's not creatures but more like visualization of other people dying. I will be telling my therapist this tomorrow. 

Mental stuff aside, my academic life is as abysmal as you can imagine, I been trying to apply to school this fall and still not succeed. Soo much crap just to apply to my local community collage! I even went here in 2017 and still wanted my freaking high school transcript!! I dropped out due to low self esteem issues and depression like usually.

Past life? I am idiot how can't do the most basic of task without requiring help/dependent on others, I blame my family and myself for my sheltered upbringing (I am 27). Now being a sheltered child had many many horrible traits for me, I easily got taken advantage and screwed over by many people, and even got homeless due to it. And yes...I still live with my parents.

Army life was even harsher since I didn't even know to shave. I was the primary target for everyone. I only lasted 2 years before leaving early, and crap my asvab is 36 lol took me four tries for that score! WHY doe everything have to be shit all the time? Everything I was excited for when I was young got destroyed, even my teachers give me no hope, always telling me down that I will never amount to anything. They were right, I have only caused more misery.  

What do I do? I lost 59 pounds and can fit into thin clothes because everyone says getting fit and building muscle will help. I STILL FEEL NOTHING. I am in a endless blackhole. Am I really wasting more time and money by going to school to fail again?",1628042228.0,1

Why should we socialize and have fun in the physical world?,2,oxe6mu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxe6mu/why_should_we_socialize_and_have_fun_in_the/,0,"1. I understand that collaboration between people is vital to innovate new things that can benefit the society we live in. In other words, if the communication is strictly about work & to achieve common goals, it’s superb and I support it wholeheartedly.

2. I also understand socializing on the internet forums and communities since you have more time to think and analyze questions and reply more thoroughly (also anonymity). It’s insightful and you leave footprints so that anyone who has a similar question can read up previous discussions and later offer insights or move on if the answer was satisfactory. 

3. I understand having fun alone because there’s no point in sharing those moments with others since no one fully understands what others experience. You always experience everything in solitude. Do we need to have someone by our side to feel our happiness better? Or do we lie to ourselves? I don’t feel like sharing my happiness with others since it’s mine. Even if I do so, you can only share the glimpse of it and I don’t see the need of expressing something that can’t be fully communicated.

What I don’t understand is:

1. Having fun in the physical world where everything seems pretentious, unfruitful and a total waste of time. I mean, I’ve had great discussions with people but it never has the same or a better high. Communicating with the same people over and over eventually leads to dullness and mediocrity. 

What should be the goal of meeting up and talking & discussing common interests rather than deepening our knowledge about then? Isn’t everything else just a distraction from the inevitable? That we are going to die? Or our wrongdoings will destroy us before the natural death from old age?

By common interests I mean what involves all of us. Global warming, politics, technology, science and our struggles. In other words, I understand communication and collaboration if it’s for the sake of the society’s well-being.

I feel like wasting my time when I’m with other people. It’s all so weird how similarly every conversation starts and ends. It feels like in the physical word everyone wants to gain something from a social situation. Ego boost, status, sex, pity, approval, etc.

The internet is freer from this hideousness and it feels like people are more open to sincere collaboration than in real life.

Am I missing something? Real life socializing, outgoing, drinking, sex, love - is this all a lie? Pretentious? Self-centered? 

I have been isolating more and more lately and I don’t know if there’s something I am missing. 

I am a highly-functional person with highly-developed social skills to blend and properly function in the society I live in. I’ve been faking to be a valuable society member for a long time and pretentiously giving friends & family what is expected from me which I never thought to have any significance unlike them.

I was pretty much used as a slave for getting him off however he required or to tend to his attentive needs, I slept in the same bed with him it was not my own I basically got moved to the spare bedroom this friend would stay in

It affected me almost immediately as my relationships with friends and other family changed immediately, even now my friends can't even hug or touch me without me shaking or curling into a ball and losing my ability to converse or speak with them properly.

I have suicidal thoughts quite often I'm not at a stage I could go through with it, but I'm bothered by the thoughts quite abit I have unbearable anxiety to the point I don't really go outside and my depression just keeps me bed ridden and burnt out most days, I force myself to eat and drink I used to exercise I don't anymore.

And this friend in question would constantly push his feelings onto me I think he loved me in some delusional way especially with how he would touch or talk to me so intimately he must of seen me as more then i should've ever been in the position to be, I can't even run my own hands through my hair or along my body without just feeling my skin crawl all over and I feel so stressed thinking about those situations that I've thrown up during therapy sessions numerous times.

I try counting the days when the thought doesn’t cross my mind, but they’re hard to find.

And it gets harder every passing night, as I’m slowly approaching the reality in which I’ll have to face my master’s course chosen from necessity, my reluctantly chosen career and my unwillingly chosen future.

A few years ago I thought that I still had some control over the path my life would take - or at least, carried a bit of positive outlook on it – but now I can’t fathom how this idea ever seemed attainable.

Dreading a possible phone call from the company I sent my application to, every night I go to sleep with an ever-growing stomach ache.

Still there is no better way.

I can’t change anything, I have to go through all of it. Two more years of university, exams, thesis writing, suffering and who knows what difficulties the work application process will encompass. Medical examinations, psychological inspection, trauma-inducing trainings, and security background check…

I am so not ready for life.

For this life.

I dwell on the happenings of the past. Look at the little girl I was just some 15 years ago, and feel my heart break.

If she hadn’t been born into an emotionally neglectful and dysfunctional environment, would she be happy now? Content with herself, understanding her ability to change her life?

Maybe she would be an artist or something else by now, in a fulfilling and healthy relationship. Loved.

If that small girl was my child, I’d raise her so much different. How could anybody have a child, just to let it be, without showing affection, parental care to them? I would give her all my love and attention that I can’t give myself.

But then again, it’s only a nice thing to say. Thinking about this won’t change a thing in my future. And even if that idyllic picture was my reality, could I be truly happy? I don’t think I’d ever be able to. 

If only suicide was a viable option.

Maybe I should really just put up with the misery I threw myself into, and bear with the life I screwed up. Play the game through, as to not transfer the pain that’s deservedly mine to take, onto another person.

I am thinking in loops again and can’t get out. Suffering of the future, suicidal ideation, family bonds, suffering of the future, suicidal ideation…

How does one live a meaningless life they don’t want, existing away, barely functioning? Some humans even seem happy here. It’s absolutely incomprehensible.

I didn't know there existed a place where people were actually advocating and supporting suicide. No, I won't tell you the name, and I do not recommend going there, but I will describe how depressing and sad a place it was.

Most of the people on the board actually want to commit suicide, they fantasize about it. They think it is a great thing, and they are happy to go to their death. Why they haven't killed themselves if they beleive that, I don't know. 

They share methods, and troubleshoot the methods, and provide tips and tricks to kill youself. Several times, people actually seemed to kill themselves while on the site, live blogging their own death, and talking about how they were feeling until they were gone. It was heartbreaking, but the people seemed to be happy to go. Whether it was a hoax or they actually died, I do not know, but everybody wished them ""success.""

They represent it as a platform for free speech, but it seems obvious to me they are promoting and enabling suicide. I had quite a few discussions with the people there, trying to understand their position, but I realized that I am not like them because I actually want to live. Terrible place.

I feel bad about my boyfriend ordering food for me,2,oxbsc9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oxbsc9/i_feel_bad_about_my_boyfriend_ordering_food_for_me/,2,"My boyfriend (M19) orders food for me because I am unable to prepare food myself.

I (F19) am in a long distance relationship. We've known each other for over a year now, we've never met in person, but we facetime every day and talk for hours. He knows that my mental state is not so good. I didn't share much about it in the beginning. He only knew that my sleep schedule was very bad (I went to bed at 11:00 am). Another problem is that I am very bad at eating regularly because I have no energy to cook and there is little food in the house. I can't go to the grocery store myself and am dependent on the food in the house. I hardly have any appetite.

My bf is very  worried about this. because I am so often tired and because 500 kcal a day is simply not healthy. He has known my address for several months and he first sent me presents, letters, etc. But because I eat less and less, he wanted to order food for me for a long time. He wants to order me snacks that are easy to eat (I can't cook… nope not even milkshakes, I live off slices of bread and granola bars). Normally dinner is my only meal of the day, but because I'm skipping it more and more now, he has ordered me fast food quite often. (10 times in 2 months..) I feel very guilty about that, but I know the calories are welcome.

 His problem is that he can't physically make me food and he does know himself that it's expensive and not healthy... if I just say I'm having a bad eating day, he'll order it for me. My parents say they are ashamed and that I make my bf feel like there would be no food in the house. And I'm about to tell my boyfriend I want him to stop ordering food. Because I don't think I'm worth all that money and food. However, my bf keeps insisting that I have to keep eating and that he will continue to order food for me at all costs, especially if I'm having a really bad calorie day….

"How am I supposed to ever be ""happy""",4,ox6r79,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ox6r79/how_am_i_supposed_to_ever_be_happy/,1,"It's lost to me, how I'm actually expected to be happy. Yesterday I saw some post talking about how life is kind of like a game that everyone plays and it kind of rang true to me. Like we are playing roles and just expected to go about collecting titles, and assets, to check off the boxes of doing life right. Example, school, go to college, meet someone, start a career, get married, have children, buy a house, etc. and that seems fine I guess in theory, and for most people is enough, but I start to go crazy thinking about these things. 

One thing I think about is how my version of the college experience sucked, I'm freaking 31 and still think about this...career is awful, I've spent so much of my adult life focusing so much on work. Work that I don't enjoy, work that I don't care about, work that I only do because someone at one point was able to recommend me when I needed a job and now have a set of skills that basically pigeon hole me directly into only this industry. 

Even the concept of getting away from the traditional sense of corporate work are so annoying. Any time I think about a switch being cool, I think about how that wouldn't work either. The things I enjoy, money would never be what I can make working corporate. Those things then also require an insane amount of work to grow into something potentially awesome, again, more things I don't freaking care about. Example, say I wanted to do photography as a career, regardless of it being a overrun industry, in order to be successful, you have to do not only photos you don't want to do, you also have to then run the business side, doing sales, social media, etc etc etc. Even when I think to my first big passion, music, same thing, you have to do the social media game, pitch things to others, on and on and on. 

While I do understand the concept too that if you love it it doesn't feel like normal ""work"" but its still work and not enjoying life. Enjoying life being something that you also can't do without a lot of money. The times I find myself ""enjoying"" things most is when I can take vacations....yet again, something that requires money to do, meaning you have to work, in my case jobs that suck, in order to earn just barely enough days to ""enjoy life"" for a one week a year if you're lucky. 

I just want to DO things. I like taking photos, its fun, I'm not that good at it but also barely have a chance to focus on it. I like video, I like cooking/baking, I like making and researching coffee, I like music and playing it, but none of these things are also something that I want to do for work, they are just what I'd like to spend my time doing. 

All I want to do is just live. Enjoy life, and actually for once be happy. But instead so much of my life is focused on making some stupid manager happy, doing business for a company that doesn't give a shit about me, trying to remember to be active enough with friends and also find new things to ask friends to do with me. Remembering to post shit on social media that I don't actually care about to keep up some kind of ""image"". Keep my place spotless and looking ""cool"", try to watch enough various things to be interesting and above all, expected to somehow in a time where I meet zero new people in a city I know no one that I moved to last year, find a significant other using all of the above to seem like such a cool option...I'm just so sick of it all. I wake up every day wishing it wasn't a new one having to do everything all over again. Not that I wish I was dead, I don't, I want to be happy so badly, it just seems like any time I am happy it lasts for a max of a few minutes before reality slaps me back in the face again.",1628007178.0,1

About 10 months ago I started experiencing a lot of unpleasant physical sensations in my body, like for example my chest and stomach are always burning up and my head as well, just my entire body feels inflamed. I went to the hospital twice, I went to several doctors to check me , I did blood tests, I started taking vitamins, I’m trying to improve my diet again after 11 months of binging and eating like shit because of an unholy amount of stress. This has only been adding to my suffering even more. I was getting on and off suicidal for the last months since this started because each day I think I’m going to die, and since I started obsessing about death I just couldn’t handle that thought so I became suicidal again. I had to do all my exams with this feeling, go through a depressive episode which I can’t seem to recover from, panic attacks every day, anxiety from literally anything I do and suicidal thoughts all at once., that are all untreated and got worse over the years. I’m literally just 18 and I feel like my body is collapsing. I’ve already had an illness and I’m TERRIFIED of getting it back because it will fuck up my health even more. Each day I vent to this to everyone I can, cause it’s just so overwhelming. I just don’t know what to do. I always think it’s my fault for feeling unwell and I don’t want to deal with another illness because I’m scared to death of them. Idk what to do :( most doctors just tell me it’s stress but I’ve been severely stressed since I was a child due to many things and I can’t seem to shake off that feeling 
I will do more tests in the following month , but even if they find something I just don’t want to deal with it. I’ve dealt with so many things on my own that it has become debilitating. I just want to feel ok for once :(",1628010946.0,1

Wondering though if it’s possible to ever have that because after only about 3 years of the longest job I’m able to hold I’m wondering how I’m ever going to make it long term.

This award, that medal, this scholarship, valedictorian, 4.0, acceptance to Yale, UPenn, Vanderbilt, etc etc. I studied and worked my ass off in high school. I pushed and pushed until I thought I couldn’t make it. Things fell apart, and I fell into survival mode; I just needed to make it through alive. Every day became a struggle. One day I was anxiety-ridden, irritable, mad, self-loathing. The next I was depressed with no motivation to walk from class to class. The day after, I felt nothing. Emptiness. Numbness. Dissociation. I genuinely don’t know how I made it. It’s not that I wanted to kill myself… I just didn’t want to be alive anymore.

I’ve graduated now, and I’m headed off to college in a few weeks. But, I have nothing to show for the past 4 Years I’ve endured. Not much compared to all the other people that were able to keep their head on their shoulders through high school and get into phenomenal colleges. They’re going to make it through— land those internships, graduate top of their class, do well financially for their future families. My future is a question mark. My past is questionable. I don’t feel present either.

Unlike an award or a scholarship, I have nothing to show for what I’ve fought for these past few years. No one knows except me and God. And I don’t know how to feel about that. The product of my success is that I am still standing here… more or less in one piece. I’ve been broken numerous times, but I'm still standing. And you would never know from my resume.
